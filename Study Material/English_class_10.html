            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
                postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.
                Compassionate and Kind: Moved by Lencho's faith, he rallies the office to help anonymously.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

                Compassionate: They contribute money, demonstrating their willingness to help those in need.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

                Represents Faith and Hope: While not a physical character, God embodies the concept of faith as a source
                of hope and the belief in a higher power's intervention.</pre>

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            </p>
            <div class="ans">

                ques.3. At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions “an extraordinary human disaster”. What does he
                mean by this? What is the “glorious human achievement” he speaks of at the end?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By ‘an extraordinary human disaster’ Mandela means to state the practice of apartheid in South
                Africa. During this there was a racial segregation based on colour and the blacks suffered a lot. They
                were not allowed to demand freedom or any right. Mandela himself did spend many years on infamous
                ‘Robben Island’ as a prisoner where he was beaten mercilessly. He considered it as great glorious human
                achievement that a black person became the President of a country where the blacks were not even
                considered human beings and were treated badly.

                because not too long ago, the South Africans were considered outlaws. He thus thanks all of them for
                having come to witness the historical ceremony. This was a gesture of international recognition to a
                newly born free democratic nation and it could be considered as a common victory for justice, peace and
                human dignity.</div>

                loyalty which was of great significance as during apartheid era they would have arrested him. The change
                in their attitude was because of struggle and sacrifices put in by many heroes of South Africa. This

            <div class="ans">
                Ans. (i) In the first decade of the century, the whites erected a system of racial domination against
                the blacks, thus creating the basis of one of the harshest and most inhumane societies the world had
                ever known.
                (ii) In the final decade of the 20th century, the . previous system had been overturned and replaced by
                one which recognised rights and freedom of all people regardless of color of their skin.

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. For Mandela courage does not mean the absence of fear but a victory over fear. According to him

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mandela mentions that every man has twin obligations. The first is to his family, parents, wife and
                children; the second obligation is to his people, his community and his country.

            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Like any other kid, for Mandela freedom meant to make merry and enjoy the blissful life. Once one
                becomes an adult, antics of childhood looks like transitory because most of the childish activities are
                wasteful from an adult’s perspective. Once you are adult, you have to earn a livelihood to bring the
                bacon home. Its only then when you get an honourable existence in the family and in the society.

                of hatred who is behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. He realises that both the oppressor
                and the oppressed are robbed of their humanity and peace.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Why did such a large number of international leaders attend the inauguration ? What did it
                signify the triumph of?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. To be the part of the inauguration, international leaders showed a gesture of solidarity from
                international community to the idea of end of apartheid. It was the significance of the victory of good
                over evil and triumph of a tolerant society without any discrimination.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. What does Mandela mean when he says he is “simply the sum of all those African patriots”, who
                had gone before him ?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By saying that he is simply the sum of all those African patriots, Mandela wants to pay his tribute
                to all the people who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of freedom. He says that he is grateful
                to those who had gone before him because those heroes of past had paved the path of co-operation and
                unity for him. Therefore, he could try to come to power to bring equality for his people with their
                support.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Would you agree that the “depths of oppression” create “heights of character”? How does Mandela
                illustrate this? Can you add your own examples to this argument ?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. I agree with the statement that depths of oppression create heights of character. Nelson Mandela
                illustrates this by giving examples of great heroes of South Africa like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu and
                others who were inspired to sacrifice their lives in the long freedom struggle.
                India is full of such examples, during our freedom struggle there was a galaxy of leaders of great
                characters and the oppression of British rule created and encouraged people of noble characters like
                Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, JL Nehru, Chandra Shekhar Ajad, Sardar Bhagat Singh and many more. If
                we compare them with the quality of political leaders India is having today, then Nelson Mandela seems
                to be absolutely right.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. How did Mandela’s understanding of freedom change with age and experience?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. With age and experience, Mandela understood the real meaning of freedom. As a young boy, he thought
                that he was born free and believed that as long as he obeyed his father and abided by the customs of his
                tribe, he was free in every possible manner. As he grew older, freedom to raise a family and freedom to
                earn livelihood started dominating his thoughts. Gradually he realised that he was selfish during his
                boyhood. He slowly understood that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the freedom
                of all blacks. It was the freedom from fear and prejudice. Age and experience widened his perspective of
                freedom.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. How did Mandela’s ‘hunger for freedom’ change his life?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mandela realised in his youth that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the
                freedom of all blacks. This changed the fearfulman to a fearless rebel.
                He sacrificed the comforts of a settled family life to fight for a greater cause. He joined the African
                National Congress and this changed him from a frightened young man into a bold one who fought against
                racial prejudice.

            <span>[Summary of CHAPTER : 2 - " Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom " ] </span>
            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">["__The Spark That Ignited a Long Walk: A Summary of Nelson Mandela's Fight for Freedom__"]
            </p>
            <p class="que">The excerpt from Nelson Mandela's autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," likely focuses on
                his early life and the awakening of his fight against apartheid in South Africa. While it might not be a
                full chapter, it offers a glimpse into the seeds of a lifelong struggle. Here's a detailed breakdown:
            </p>

            <p class="que"># From Tribal Freedom to a Universal Yearning:</p>

            <p class="que">The young Nelson Mandela cherished the freedom he experienced within the structure of his
                Xhosa tribe. He likely enjoyed a sense of belonging and a degree of personal liberty.</p>
            <p class="que">However, this understanding of freedom underwent a crucial transformation. Witnessing the
                harsh realities of racial discrimination against Black South Africans exposed him to a deeper meaning of
                freedom – one that encompassed collective liberation.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Birth of a Crusader:</p>

            <p class="que">This awakening sparked a yearning for a more just society, a society where freedom wasn't
                restricted by the color of one's skin. This desire for collective liberation became the driving force
                behind his actions.</p>
            <p class="que">The comfortable life he might have led within the tribal structure was no longer enough. He
                yearned to be part of something bigger, something that challenged the status quo.</p>
            <p class="que"># Joining the Fight: The Price of Freedom</p>

            <p class="que">The text likely mentions Mandela's involvement with the African National Congress (ANC), a
                key organization fighting against the oppressive apartheid regime. This was a defining moment, a
                commitment to a cause far greater than himself.</p>
            <p class="que">The excerpt might not delve into the details of the sacrifices he made, but it subtly hints
                at the challenges he embraced. Joining the ANC probably meant giving up a life of relative ease and
                security. It meant facing the wrath of a powerful regime and putting his own freedom at risk.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Long Walk Begins: Setting the Stage for the Future</p>

            <p class="que">The chapter doesn't explicitly mention Mandela's imprisonment on Robben Island or his
                eventual rise to presidency. However, it provides a crucial foundation for understanding his unwavering
                commitment to freedom and justice.</p>
            <p class="que">This glimpse into his early life sets the stage for exploring the long and arduous journey he
                undertook. It allows us to appreciate the unwavering spirit that propelled him to fight for a cause
                bigger than himself.</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes and Significance:</p>

            <p class="que">The excerpt beautifully portrays the evolution of Mandela's understanding of freedom. It
                transforms from a personal desire to a collective yearning for racial equality.</p>
            <p class="que">It highlights the courage it takes to stand up against injustice, even when it means
                sacrificing personal comfort and safety.</p>
            <p class="que">This is just the beginning of Mandela's incredible story. The excerpt serves as a springboard
                to delve deeper into his struggles, the fight against apartheid, and the eventual triumph of democracy
                in South Africa.</p>
            <p class="que">This summary goes beyond a simple listing of events and delves into the deeper meaning behind
                Mandela's actions. It highlights the themes of sacrifice, courage, and the evolution of a freedom
                fighter. By understanding his early motivations, we gain a deeper appreciation for his lifelong
                dedication to dismantling apartheid and building a more just South Africa.</p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are afraid to make their
                first flight, or are some birds more timid than others? Do you think a human baby also finds it a
                challenge to take its first step?
            </p>
            <p class="ans">
                Ans. The young seagull was afraid to fly because it was his first flight and he feared of falling and
                hurting himself. He thought that his wings would not support him while flying. Yes, it is natural that
                doing something for the first time is a bit challenging and fearful. All birds must be afraid to make
                their first flight.
                Similarly, a human baby is also afraid of taking the first step and find it challenging when he learns
                to crawl or stand up without support.

                to finally fly?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The young seagull was very hungry. It was this hunger that ultimately compelled it to fly. Its
                hunger intensified when it saw its mother tearing at a piece of fish that lay at her feet. It cried to
                her, begging her to get some food. When its mother came towards it with food in her beak, it screamed
                with joy and anticipation. However, she stopped midway. It wondered why she did not come nearer. Not
                being able to resist or controfits hunger any longer, it dived at the food in its mother’s beak. At that
                moment, his hunger overpowered his fear of the great expanse of sea beneath the cliff. Finally, this
                plunge was followed by the natural reaction of its body, i.e. to fly.

            <p class="que">
                ques.3. They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father and mother threaten
                him and cajole him to fly?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Seagull’s parents had tried everything but he was reluctant to fly due to fear of falling down. He
                looked at his brothers and sister but wouldn’t make any efforts. Thats why the whole family had left him
                alone and threatened and cojoled him to come but every effort went in vain.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Have you ever had a similar experience, where your parents encouraged you to do something that
                you were too scared to try? Discuss this in pairs or groups.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. (Suggested Answer) Yes, I had a similar experience while leaning to ride a bicycle in class VI. In
                my initial attempts, I fell down everytime and developed a fear of cycling which was difficult to
                overcome.
                No amount of provoking and cajoling could let me try it again, but my father encouraged me to overcome
                the fear and helped me as he was adamant on my learning cycling. He took me on a mound near village and
                made me sit and asked me to put my hands on the handle and feet on the paddle. It sped down and I
                enjoyed it without fear which developed my confidence.


                Thus, I overcame my fear of cycling and started riding a cycle after a few practice.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. In the case of a bird flying, it seems a natural act, and a foregone conclusion that it should
                succeed. In the examples you have given in Answer to the previous question, was your success guaranteed,
                or was it important for you to try, regardless of a possibility of failure?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans.We face some problems in the initial stage while learning new skill. Due to the fear of failure, we
                hesitate to perform a task or to do something new. In case of the seagull his parents cajoled him to
                fly. In the example I have given in the answer of previous question, I was cajoled by my father to learn
                cycling. So, at that stage, I was to learn cycling as it was very important for me to overcome my fear.
                Yes, my success was guaranteed because if someone is determined to do something then success is assured.
                Moreover as said, practice, makes a man perfect.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. “I’ll take the risk”. What is the risk? Why does the narrator take it?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. A huge storm was brewing up and the author was
                keen to reach his home to spend his holiday with his family. So, he decided to fly through the storm as
                he did not want to miss the chance to meet his family at breakfast. Thus he took the risk even when the
                visibility was almost zero in the storm.
            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Describe the narrator’s experience as he flew the aeroplane into the storm.
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. As the pilot (author) entered the storm, his plane started jumping and twisting. He could not see
                anything outside the plane as it was black. When he looked at compass and other instruments they had
                stopped to function due to storm. It was a terrible and fearsome experience for him. The fuel tank was
                almost empty and he could not fly more than ten minutes. Then he saw another black aeroplane by his side
                and the pilot of the plane signalled him to follow. It was a surprise for the narrator as the other
                black plane was having no light. He followed him without any choice and landed safely on the runway.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Why does the narrator say, “I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the old Dakota…”?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Seagull’s parents had tried everything but he was reluctant to fly due to fear of falling down. He
                looked at his brothers and sister but wouldn’t make any efforts. Thats why the whole family had left him
                alone and threatened and cojoled him to come but every effort went in vain.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. What made the woman in the Control Centre look at the narrator strangely?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The woman in the Control Centre looked at the
                narrator strangely because the narrator asked him about the black aeroplane and she saw no one except
                the narrator’s in the sky during the storm. Even the radar showed only the narrator’s plane that night
                in the sky.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Who do you think helped the narrator to reach safely? Discuss this among yourselves and give
                reasons for your answer.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. It is very difficult to say about the unknown pilot who helped the narrator. But probably it was
                the narrator himself that helped him to overcome the fear in the storm as no other plane was seen in the
                radar except the narrator’s Dakota plane. In that fearsome situation, he might have been hallucinating.
                He himself was a good pilot and brave enough who helped himself land safely.

            <p class="que"># The Hesitant Flyer: A Summary of "His First Flight"</p>
            <p class="que">The first story in "Two Stories About Flying," titled "His First Flight" by Liam O'Flaherty,
                tells the tale of a young seagull who overcomes his fear to take his first flight. Here's a detailed
                breakdown of the story's key elements:</p>

            <p class="que"># The Weight of Fear:</p>

            <p class="que">The protagonist is a young seagull, on the cusp of fledging. Unlike his younger siblings who
                readily embrace the skies, he's crippled by fear.</p>
            <p class="que">The vastness of the open air and the thought of leaving the safety of the ledge terrify him.
                This fear is a powerful force that holds him back from experiencing the freedom of flight.</p>
            <p class="que"># Parental Pressure and Hunger Pangs:</p>

            <p class="que">The young seagull's parents try to motivate him to fly. They encourage him, scold him, and
                even threaten to leave him hungry if he doesn't take the leap.</p>
            <p class="que">Hunger becomes an additional pressure, forcing him to confront his fear in order to reach the
                food his parents offer.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unplanned Leap:</p>

            <p class="que">In a moment of desperation, driven by hunger and unable to resist the lure of the fish
                offered by his mother, the young seagull lunges forward and tumbles off the ledge.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unexpected Embrace of Flight:</p>

            <p class="que">In a surprising turn of events, the young seagull doesn't plummet to his death. Instead, he
                discovers to his astonishment that his wings hold him aloft.</p>
            <p class="que">The fear that had paralyzed him melts away, replaced by the exhilaration of flying. He soars
                through the air, experiencing the freedom he was previously too afraid to grasp.</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes Explored:</p>

            <p class="que">Overcoming Fear: The story is a classic tale of conquering one's fears. The young seagull
                represents anyone who struggles to take a leap of faith and step outside their comfort zone.</p>
            <p class="que">Parental Guidance: The parents' tough love approach, though seemingly harsh, ultimately
                pushes the young seagull to overcome his fear and achieve his potential.</p>
            <p class="que">The Power of Instinct: Despite his initial fear, the young seagull possesses an innate
                ability to fly. Once airborne, his instincts take over, allowing him to experience the joy of flight.
            </p>
            <p class="que"># Symbolism:</p>

            <p class="que">The vast sky represents freedom and possibility. It's a place the young seagull fears but
                ultimately learns to embrace.</p>
            <p class="que">The ledge symbolizes the young seagull's comfort zone, a place of safety but also limitation.
                By leaving the ledge, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
            <p class="que">Overall, "His First Flight" is a heartwarming story that celebrates the triumph of courage
                over fear. It reminds us that sometimes, the greatest discoveries lie just beyond our comfort zones.</p>

            <p class="que">The second story in "Two Stories About Flying," "The Black Aeroplane," by Frederick Forsyth,
                is a suspenseful tale filled with mystery and a touch of the supernatural. Here's a detailed breakdown
                of the story's key elements:</p>

            <p class="que"># The Setting:</p>

            <p class="que">The story takes place during a nighttime flight from Paris to London. The protagonist, a
                pilot (whose name is never revealed), is looking forward to a reunion with his family and a delicious
                breakfast upon landing.</p>
            <p class="que">#The Storm:</p>

            <p class="que">As the pilot flies over Paris, he encounters a massive storm with dark, threatening clouds.
                He has a decision to make: turn back to safety in Paris or continue towards London.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Risky Choice:</p>

            <p class="que">Driven by the desire to reunite with his family, the pilot makes a risky decision to fly
                through the storm. This choice sets the stage for the mysterious events that follow.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Black Aeroplane:</p>

            <p class="que">As visibility plummets due to the storm, the pilot's instruments malfunction - the compass
                goes dead, the radio cuts out, and the fuel gauge becomes unreliable. Suddenly, he spots another
                airplane, completely black and without any lights, flying ahead.</p>
            <p class="que"># Following the Unknown:</p>

            <p class="que">With no other options and a dwindling fuel supply, the pilot makes a desperate decision. He
                decides to follow the black aeroplane, hoping it will lead him to safety. This act of trust in a
                mysterious unknown entity adds to the suspense.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Glimmer of Hope:</p>

            <p class="que">After what feels like an eternity, the black aeroplane leads the pilot to a row of lights on
                the ground, a runway! He manages to land the plane safely, completely disoriented and bewildered by the
                experience.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Disappearance:</p>

            <p class="que">The pilot rushes to the airport terminal, desperate to find out more about the black
                aeroplane that guided him. However, to his utter astonishment, no one at the airport has any knowledge
                of another plane landing that night. The black aeroplane seems to have vanished without a trace.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unexplained:</p>

            <p class="que">The story ends with the pilot left pondering the inexplicable events of the flight. Was the
                black aeroplane a figment of his imagination, a hallucination brought on by the stress of the storm? Or
                was it something more – a ghostly guide or a supernatural phenomenon?</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes:</p>

            <p class="que">The story explores themes of trust, fate, and the power of the unknown. It forces the reader
                to question the nature of reality and the possibility of encountering the inexplicable.</p>
            <p class="que">The pilot's risky decision to fly through the storm and his subsequent dependence on the
                black aeroplane highlight the dangers of prioritizing personal desires over safety.</p>
            <p class="que"># Open Ending:</p>

            <p class="que">The story's strength lies in its open ending. It leaves the reader free to draw their own
                conclusions about the black aeroplane and the pilot's experience. This ambiguity adds to the story's
                lasting impact.</p>
            <p class="que">Overall, "The Black Aeroplane" is a thrilling and thought-provoking story that leaves a
                lasting impression on the reader by weaving together themes of suspense, mystery, and the unknown.</p>

            <p class="que"> The Young Seagull: This unnamed seagull is the protagonist of the story. As detailed
                previously, he undergoes a significant transformation from a fearful and dependent chick to a courageous
                and independent flyer.</p>
            <p class="que"> While there aren't other fully developed characters, there are some additional elements to
                consider:</p>

            <p class="que"> The Parents: The young seagull's parents act as mentors and guides. They encourage him to
                fly, but ultimately force him to take the leap himself through tough love.</p>
            <p class="que"> The Siblings: The young seagull's siblings who have already learned to fly serve as both
                inspiration and a source of envy for the protagonist. They represent the freedom and independence he
                desires.</p>

            <span>[Character Sketch of PART : II -- " the Black Aeroplane " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># The Pilot:</p>

            <p class="que">Personality: The pilot is never given a name, making him a more universal character. He seems
                to be a dedicated family man, eager to reunite with his loved ones and enjoy a good breakfast upon
                landing.</p>
            <p class="que">Motivation: He prioritizes reuniting with his family over safety, which leads him to make the
                risky decision to fly through the storm. This decision sets the stage for the encounter with the black
                aeroplane.</p>
            <p class="que">Development: Throughout the story, the pilot experiences a range of emotions. Initially
                confident, he becomes increasingly disoriented and frightened as the storm intensifies. He then exhibits
                desperation as he follows the black aeroplane and finally relief upon landing safely.</p>
            <p class="que">Significance: The pilot acts as the viewpoint character, drawing the reader into the
                suspenseful experience of the flight. His confusion and lack of answers regarding the black aeroplane
                mirror the reader's own uncertainty.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Black Aeroplane:</p>

            <p class="que">Description: The black aeroplane is shrouded in mystery. It's completely black, has no
                lights, and seems to appear and disappear without a trace.</p>
            <p class="que">Function: The black aeroplane acts as a mysterious guide, leading the pilot through the storm
                and to safety. However, its motives and origins remain unknown.</p>
            <p class="que">Impact: The black aeroplane adds a layer of suspense and the supernatural to the story. Its
                unexplained presence leaves the reader questioning its reality and purpose.</p>
            <p class="que">While there are no other fully developed characters, the story also mentions:</p>

            <p class="que">The Pilot's Family: Though unseen, they represent the pilot's motivation for taking risks and
                his desire for safety.</p>
            The Airport Staff: Their lack of knowledge about the black aeroplane further deepens the mystery.

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER-3 : - " Part I - HIS FIRST FLIGHT " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile:</p>

            <p class="que">"The wind whipped through his feathers like a cold knife." (This compares the wind's effect
                to a sharp object, highlighting its intensity.)</p>
            <p class="que">"And the wrinkled water below looked like a creased green tablecloth." (This simile helps the
                reader visualize the appearance of the water from the seagull's perspective.)</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor:</p>

            <p class="que">"Hunger gnawed at him." (Hunger is personified as an animal gnawing, emphasizing its
                intensity.)</p>
            <p class="que">"The ledge was his universe." (The ledge represents the young seagull's limited world before
                he learns to fly.)</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification:</p>

            <p class="que">"The wind called to him." (The wind is given a human quality of calling, making it seem more
                inviting or persuasive.)</p>
            <p class="que">"The white caps of the waves danced below." (The waves are given the human quality of
                dancing, creating a sense of movement and life.)</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery:</p>

            <p class="que">The story heavily utilizes vivid imagery to describe the scene. Passages describe the
                vastness of the sky, the crashing waves below, and the feeling of wind rushing through the feathers.
                This imagery helps the reader experience the world through the young seagull's eyes.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition:</p>

            <p class="que">The repeated phrase "I can't" emphasizes the young seagull's fear and initial resistance to
                flying.</p>
            <p class="que">The use of short, choppy sentences during the initial flight sequence reflects the young
                seagull's nervousness and lack of control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch3">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER-3 : - " Part II - THE BLACK AEROPLANE " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The entire concept of the black aeroplane itself could be seen as a metaphor.
                It's a physical plane, but it also represents the unknown, the element of mystery and even the
                possibility of the supernatural that guides the pilot through the storm.</p>

            <p class="que"># Simile: There might be instances where the pilot compares the storm's intensity or the
                disorientation he feels to something else. For example, "The cockpit spun like a top" or "The rain
                lashed against the windshield like a thousand tiny fists."</p>

            <p class="que"># Symbolism: The storm itself can be seen as a symbol of the pilot's internal struggle. His
                fear and uncertainty are mirrored by the turbulence and darkness of the weather.</p>

            <div class="ans">
                ans. Yes, Anne was right when she said so because most of the people don’t want to give importance to a child’s perspective toward the world because they are too immature for the world.

            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne took perfect example of Mr Keesing as an unpredictable teacher because Mr Keesing seemed to be indifferent towards Annes’ behaviour. Earlier he laughed but later he allowed Anne to talk in the class post reading her essays.

                5. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking.

                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch5">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the

                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called

            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.

                postmaster.</pre>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch9">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch1">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch2">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch3">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            </div>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch6">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.

            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch7">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.

            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch8">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>

                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">

                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.

                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">

                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <span>[ Character Sketch of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

            Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.
            Compassionate and Kind: Moved by Lencho's faith, he rallies the office to help anonymously.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

            Compassionate: They contribute money, demonstrating their willingness to help those in need.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

            Represents Faith and Hope: While not a physical character, God embodies the concept of faith as a source
            of hope and the belief in a higher power's intervention.</pre>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch9">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>
