            </div>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <span>[Summary of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ] </span>
            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
                postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.

            <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            </p>
            <div class="ans">

                ques.3. At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions “an extraordinary human disaster”. What does he
                mean by this? What is the “glorious human achievement” he speaks of at the end?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By ‘an extraordinary human disaster’ Mandela means to state the practice of apartheid in South
                Africa. During this there was a racial segregation based on colour and the blacks suffered a lot. They
                were not allowed to demand freedom or any right. Mandela himself did spend many years on infamous
                ‘Robben Island’ as a prisoner where he was beaten mercilessly. He considered it as great glorious human
                achievement that a black person became the President of a country where the blacks were not even
                considered human beings and were treated badly.

                because not too long ago, the South Africans were considered outlaws. He thus thanks all of them for
                having come to witness the historical ceremony. This was a gesture of international recognition to a
                newly born free democratic nation and it could be considered as a common victory for justice, peace and
                human dignity.</div>

            </p>
            <div class="ans">

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mandela mentions that every man has twin obligations. The first is to his family, parents, wife and

            <div class="ans">

                becomes an adult, antics of childhood looks like transitory because most of the childish activities are
                wasteful from an adult’s perspective. Once you are adult, you have to earn a livelihood to bring the

                and the oppressed are robbed of their humanity and peace.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Why did such a large number of international leaders attend the inauguration ? What did it
                signify the triumph of?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. To be the part of the inauguration, international leaders showed a gesture of solidarity from
                international community to the idea of end of apartheid. It was the significance of the victory of good
                over evil and triumph of a tolerant society without any discrimination.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. What does Mandela mean when he says he is “simply the sum of all those African patriots”, who
                had gone before him ?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By saying that he is simply the sum of all those African patriots, Mandela wants to pay his tribute
                to all the people who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of freedom. He says that he is grateful
                to those who had gone before him because those heroes of past had paved the path of co-operation and
                unity for him. Therefore, he could try to come to power to bring equality for his people with their
                support.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Would you agree that the “depths of oppression” create “heights of character”? How does Mandela
                illustrate this? Can you add your own examples to this argument ?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. I agree with the statement that depths of oppression create heights of character. Nelson Mandela
                illustrates this by giving examples of great heroes of South Africa like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu and
                others who were inspired to sacrifice their lives in the long freedom struggle.
                India is full of such examples, during our freedom struggle there was a galaxy of leaders of great
                characters and the oppression of British rule created and encouraged people of noble characters like
                Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, JL Nehru, Chandra Shekhar Ajad, Sardar Bhagat Singh and many more. If
                we compare them with the quality of political leaders India is having today, then Nelson Mandela seems
                to be absolutely right.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. How did Mandela’s understanding of freedom change with age and experience?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. With age and experience, Mandela understood the real meaning of freedom. As a young boy, he thought
                that he was born free and believed that as long as he obeyed his father and abided by the customs of his
                tribe, he was free in every possible manner. As he grew older, freedom to raise a family and freedom to
                earn livelihood started dominating his thoughts. Gradually he realised that he was selfish during his
                boyhood. He slowly understood that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the freedom
                of all blacks. It was the freedom from fear and prejudice. Age and experience widened his perspective of
                freedom.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. How did Mandela’s ‘hunger for freedom’ change his life?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mandela realised in his youth that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the
                freedom of all blacks. This changed the fearfulman to a fearless rebel.
                He sacrificed the comforts of a settled family life to fight for a greater cause. He joined the African
                National Congress and this changed him from a frightened young man into a bold one who fought against
                racial prejudice.

            <span>[Summary of CHAPTER : 2 - " Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom " ] </span>
            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">["__The Spark That Ignited a Long Walk: A Summary of Nelson Mandela's Fight for Freedom__"]
            </p>
            <p class="que">The excerpt from Nelson Mandela's autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," likely focuses on
                his early life and the awakening of his fight against apartheid in South Africa. While it might not be a
                full chapter, it offers a glimpse into the seeds of a lifelong struggle. Here's a detailed breakdown:
            </p>

            <p class="que"># From Tribal Freedom to a Universal Yearning:</p>

            <p class="que">The young Nelson Mandela cherished the freedom he experienced within the structure of his
                Xhosa tribe. He likely enjoyed a sense of belonging and a degree of personal liberty.</p>
            <p class="que">However, this understanding of freedom underwent a crucial transformation. Witnessing the
                harsh realities of racial discrimination against Black South Africans exposed him to a deeper meaning of
                freedom – one that encompassed collective liberation.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Birth of a Crusader:</p>

            <p class="que">This awakening sparked a yearning for a more just society, a society where freedom wasn't
                restricted by the color of one's skin. This desire for collective liberation became the driving force
                behind his actions.</p>
            <p class="que">The comfortable life he might have led within the tribal structure was no longer enough. He
                yearned to be part of something bigger, something that challenged the status quo.</p>
            <p class="que"># Joining the Fight: The Price of Freedom</p>

            <p class="que">The text likely mentions Mandela's involvement with the African National Congress (ANC), a
                key organization fighting against the oppressive apartheid regime. This was a defining moment, a
                commitment to a cause far greater than himself.</p>
            <p class="que">The excerpt might not delve into the details of the sacrifices he made, but it subtly hints
                at the challenges he embraced. Joining the ANC probably meant giving up a life of relative ease and
                security. It meant facing the wrath of a powerful regime and putting his own freedom at risk.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Long Walk Begins: Setting the Stage for the Future</p>

            <p class="que">The chapter doesn't explicitly mention Mandela's imprisonment on Robben Island or his
                eventual rise to presidency. However, it provides a crucial foundation for understanding his unwavering
                commitment to freedom and justice.</p>
            <p class="que">This glimpse into his early life sets the stage for exploring the long and arduous journey he
                undertook. It allows us to appreciate the unwavering spirit that propelled him to fight for a cause
                bigger than himself.</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes and Significance:</p>

            <p class="que">The excerpt beautifully portrays the evolution of Mandela's understanding of freedom. It
                transforms from a personal desire to a collective yearning for racial equality.</p>
            <p class="que">It highlights the courage it takes to stand up against injustice, even when it means
                sacrificing personal comfort and safety.</p>
            <p class="que">This is just the beginning of Mandela's incredible story. The excerpt serves as a springboard
                to delve deeper into his struggles, the fight against apartheid, and the eventual triumph of democracy
                in South Africa.</p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are afraid to make their
                first flight, or are some birds more timid than others? Do you think a human baby also finds it a
                challenge to take its first step?
            </p>
            <p class="ans">
                Ans. The young seagull was afraid to fly because it was his first flight and he feared of falling and
                hurting himself. He thought that his wings would not support him while flying. Yes, it is natural that
                doing something for the first time is a bit challenging and fearful. All birds must be afraid to make
                their first flight.
                Similarly, a human baby is also afraid of taking the first step and find it challenging when he learns
                to crawl or stand up without support.

            </p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. “The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What compelled the young seagull
                to finally fly?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The young seagull was very hungry. It was this hunger that ultimately compelled it to fly. Its
                hunger intensified when it saw its mother tearing at a piece of fish that lay at her feet. It cried to
                her, begging her to get some food. When its mother came towards it with food in her beak, it screamed
                with joy and anticipation. However, she stopped midway. It wondered why she did not come nearer. Not
                being able to resist or controfits hunger any longer, it dived at the food in its mother’s beak. At that
                moment, his hunger overpowered his fear of the great expanse of sea beneath the cliff. Finally, this
                plunge was followed by the natural reaction of its body, i.e. to fly.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                ques.3. They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father and mother threaten
                him and cajole him to fly?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Seagull’s parents had tried everything but he was reluctant to fly due to fear of falling down. He
                looked at his brothers and sister but wouldn’t make any efforts. Thats why the whole family had left him
                alone and threatened and cojoled him to come but every effort went in vain.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Have you ever had a similar experience, where your parents encouraged you to do something that
                you were too scared to try? Discuss this in pairs or groups.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. (Suggested Answer) Yes, I had a similar experience while leaning to ride a bicycle in class VI. In
                my initial attempts, I fell down everytime and developed a fear of cycling which was difficult to
                overcome.
                No amount of provoking and cajoling could let me try it again, but my father encouraged me to overcome
                the fear and helped me as he was adamant on my learning cycling. He took me on a mound near village and
                made me sit and asked me to put my hands on the handle and feet on the paddle. It sped down and I
                enjoyed it without fear which developed my confidence.


                Thus, I overcame my fear of cycling and started riding a cycle after a few practice.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. In the case of a bird flying, it seems a natural act, and a foregone conclusion that it should
                succeed. In the examples you have given in Answer to the previous question, was your success guaranteed,
                or was it important for you to try, regardless of a possibility of failure?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans.We face some problems in the initial stage while learning new skill. Due to the fear of failure, we
                hesitate to perform a task or to do something new. In case of the seagull his parents cajoled him to
                fly. In the example I have given in the answer of previous question, I was cajoled by my father to learn
                cycling. So, at that stage, I was to learn cycling as it was very important for me to overcome my fear.
                Yes, my success was guaranteed because if someone is determined to do something then success is assured.
                Moreover as said, practice, makes a man perfect.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. “I’ll take the risk”. What is the risk? Why does the narrator take it?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. A huge storm was brewing up and the author was
                keen to reach his home to spend his holiday with his family. So, he decided to fly through the storm as
                he did not want to miss the chance to meet his family at breakfast. Thus he took the risk even when the
                visibility was almost zero in the storm.
            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Describe the narrator’s experience as he flew the aeroplane into the storm.
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. As the pilot (author) entered the storm, his plane started jumping and twisting. He could not see
                anything outside the plane as it was black. When he looked at compass and other instruments they had
                stopped to function due to storm. It was a terrible and fearsome experience for him. The fuel tank was
                almost empty and he could not fly more than ten minutes. Then he saw another black aeroplane by his side
                and the pilot of the plane signalled him to follow. It was a surprise for the narrator as the other
                black plane was having no light. He followed him without any choice and landed safely on the runway.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Why does the narrator say, “I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the old Dakota…”?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Seagull’s parents had tried everything but he was reluctant to fly due to fear of falling down. He
                looked at his brothers and sister but wouldn’t make any efforts. Thats why the whole family had left him
                alone and threatened and cojoled him to come but every effort went in vain.
            </div>



            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. What made the woman in the Control Centre look at the narrator strangely?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The woman in the Control Centre looked at the
                narrator strangely because the narrator asked him about the black aeroplane and she saw no one except
                the narrator’s in the sky during the storm. Even the radar showed only the narrator’s plane that night
                in the sky.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Who do you think helped the narrator to reach safely? Discuss this among yourselves and give
                reasons for your answer.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. It is very difficult to say about the unknown pilot who helped the narrator. But probably it was
                the narrator himself that helped him to overcome the fear in the storm as no other plane was seen in the
                radar except the narrator’s Dakota plane. In that fearsome situation, he might have been hallucinating.
                He himself was a good pilot and brave enough who helped himself land safely.

            <p class="que"># The Hesitant Flyer: A Summary of "His First Flight"</p>
            <p class="que">The first story in "Two Stories About Flying," titled "His First Flight" by Liam O'Flaherty,
                tells the tale of a young seagull who overcomes his fear to take his first flight. Here's a detailed
                breakdown of the story's key elements:</p>

            <p class="que"># The Weight of Fear:</p>

            <p class="que">The protagonist is a young seagull, on the cusp of fledging. Unlike his younger siblings who
                readily embrace the skies, he's crippled by fear.</p>
            <p class="que">The vastness of the open air and the thought of leaving the safety of the ledge terrify him.
                This fear is a powerful force that holds him back from experiencing the freedom of flight.</p>
            <p class="que"># Parental Pressure and Hunger Pangs:</p>

            <p class="que">The young seagull's parents try to motivate him to fly. They encourage him, scold him, and
                even threaten to leave him hungry if he doesn't take the leap.</p>
            <p class="que">Hunger becomes an additional pressure, forcing him to confront his fear in order to reach the
                food his parents offer.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unplanned Leap:</p>

            <p class="que">In a moment of desperation, driven by hunger and unable to resist the lure of the fish
                offered by his mother, the young seagull lunges forward and tumbles off the ledge.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unexpected Embrace of Flight:</p>

            <p class="que">In a surprising turn of events, the young seagull doesn't plummet to his death. Instead, he
                discovers to his astonishment that his wings hold him aloft.</p>
            <p class="que">The fear that had paralyzed him melts away, replaced by the exhilaration of flying. He soars
                through the air, experiencing the freedom he was previously too afraid to grasp.</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes Explored:</p>

            <p class="que">Overcoming Fear: The story is a classic tale of conquering one's fears. The young seagull
                represents anyone who struggles to take a leap of faith and step outside their comfort zone.</p>
            <p class="que">Parental Guidance: The parents' tough love approach, though seemingly harsh, ultimately
                pushes the young seagull to overcome his fear and achieve his potential.</p>
            <p class="que">The Power of Instinct: Despite his initial fear, the young seagull possesses an innate
                ability to fly. Once airborne, his instincts take over, allowing him to experience the joy of flight.
            </p>
            <p class="que"># Symbolism:</p>

            <p class="que">The vast sky represents freedom and possibility. It's a place the young seagull fears but
                ultimately learns to embrace.</p>
            <p class="que">The ledge symbolizes the young seagull's comfort zone, a place of safety but also limitation.
                By leaving the ledge, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
            <p class="que">Overall, "His First Flight" is a heartwarming story that celebrates the triumph of courage
                over fear. It reminds us that sometimes, the greatest discoveries lie just beyond our comfort zones.</p>

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->

            <p class="que">The second story in "Two Stories About Flying," "The Black Aeroplane," by Frederick Forsyth,
                is a suspenseful tale filled with mystery and a touch of the supernatural. Here's a detailed breakdown
                of the story's key elements:</p>

            <p class="que"># The Setting:</p>

            <p class="que">The story takes place during a nighttime flight from Paris to London. The protagonist, a
                pilot (whose name is never revealed), is looking forward to a reunion with his family and a delicious
                breakfast upon landing.</p>
            <p class="que">#The Storm:</p>

            <p class="que">As the pilot flies over Paris, he encounters a massive storm with dark, threatening clouds.
                He has a decision to make: turn back to safety in Paris or continue towards London.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Risky Choice:</p>

            <p class="que">Driven by the desire to reunite with his family, the pilot makes a risky decision to fly
                through the storm. This choice sets the stage for the mysterious events that follow.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Black Aeroplane:</p>

            <p class="que">As visibility plummets due to the storm, the pilot's instruments malfunction - the compass
                goes dead, the radio cuts out, and the fuel gauge becomes unreliable. Suddenly, he spots another
                airplane, completely black and without any lights, flying ahead.</p>
            <p class="que"># Following the Unknown:</p>

            <p class="que">With no other options and a dwindling fuel supply, the pilot makes a desperate decision. He
                decides to follow the black aeroplane, hoping it will lead him to safety. This act of trust in a
                mysterious unknown entity adds to the suspense.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Glimmer of Hope:</p>

            <p class="que">After what feels like an eternity, the black aeroplane leads the pilot to a row of lights on
                the ground, a runway! He manages to land the plane safely, completely disoriented and bewildered by the
                experience.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Disappearance:</p>

            <p class="que">The pilot rushes to the airport terminal, desperate to find out more about the black
                aeroplane that guided him. However, to his utter astonishment, no one at the airport has any knowledge
                of another plane landing that night. The black aeroplane seems to have vanished without a trace.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unexplained:</p>

            <p class="que">The story ends with the pilot left pondering the inexplicable events of the flight. Was the
                black aeroplane a figment of his imagination, a hallucination brought on by the stress of the storm? Or
                was it something more – a ghostly guide or a supernatural phenomenon?</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes:</p>

            <p class="que">The story explores themes of trust, fate, and the power of the unknown. It forces the reader
                to question the nature of reality and the possibility of encountering the inexplicable.</p>
            <p class="que">The pilot's risky decision to fly through the storm and his subsequent dependence on the
                black aeroplane highlight the dangers of prioritizing personal desires over safety.</p>
            <p class="que"># Open Ending:</p>

            <p class="que">The story's strength lies in its open ending. It leaves the reader free to draw their own
                conclusions about the black aeroplane and the pilot's experience. This ambiguity adds to the story's
                lasting impact.</p>
            <p class="que">Overall, "The Black Aeroplane" is a thrilling and thought-provoking story that leaves a
                lasting impression on the reader by weaving together themes of suspense, mystery, and the unknown.</p>

            <p class="que"> The Young Seagull: This unnamed seagull is the protagonist of the story. As detailed
                previously, he undergoes a significant transformation from a fearful and dependent chick to a courageous
                and independent flyer.</p>
            <p class="que"> While there aren't other fully developed characters, there are some additional elements to
                consider:</p>

            <p class="que"> The Parents: The young seagull's parents act as mentors and guides. They encourage him to
                fly, but ultimately force him to take the leap himself through tough love.</p>
            <p class="que"> The Siblings: The young seagull's siblings who have already learned to fly serve as both
                inspiration and a source of envy for the protagonist. They represent the freedom and independence he
                desires.</p>

            <p class="que"># The Pilot:</p>

            <p class="que">Personality: The pilot is never given a name, making him a more universal character. He seems
                to be a dedicated family man, eager to reunite with his loved ones and enjoy a good breakfast upon
                landing.</p>
            <p class="que">Motivation: He prioritizes reuniting with his family over safety, which leads him to make the
                risky decision to fly through the storm. This decision sets the stage for the encounter with the black
                aeroplane.</p>
            <p class="que">Development: Throughout the story, the pilot experiences a range of emotions. Initially
                confident, he becomes increasingly disoriented and frightened as the storm intensifies. He then exhibits
                desperation as he follows the black aeroplane and finally relief upon landing safely.</p>
            <p class="que">Significance: The pilot acts as the viewpoint character, drawing the reader into the
                suspenseful experience of the flight. His confusion and lack of answers regarding the black aeroplane
                mirror the reader's own uncertainty.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Black Aeroplane:</p>

            <p class="que">Description: The black aeroplane is shrouded in mystery. It's completely black, has no
                lights, and seems to appear and disappear without a trace.</p>
            <p class="que">Function: The black aeroplane acts as a mysterious guide, leading the pilot through the storm
                and to safety. However, its motives and origins remain unknown.</p>
            <p class="que">Impact: The black aeroplane adds a layer of suspense and the supernatural to the story. Its

            <p class="que"># Simile:</p>

            <p class="que">"The wind whipped through his feathers like a cold knife." (This compares the wind's effect
                to a sharp object, highlighting its intensity.)</p>
            <p class="que">"And the wrinkled water below looked like a creased green tablecloth." (This simile helps the
                reader visualize the appearance of the water from the seagull's perspective.)</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor:</p>

            <p class="que">"Hunger gnawed at him." (Hunger is personified as an animal gnawing, emphasizing its
                intensity.)</p>
            <p class="que">"The ledge was his universe." (The ledge represents the young seagull's limited world before
                he learns to fly.)</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification:</p>

            <p class="que">"The wind called to him." (The wind is given a human quality of calling, making it seem more
                inviting or persuasive.)</p>

            <p class="que"># Imagery:</p>

            <p class="que">The story heavily utilizes vivid imagery to describe the scene. Passages describe the
                vastness of the sky, the crashing waves below, and the feeling of wind rushing through the feathers.
                This imagery helps the reader experience the world through the young seagull's eyes.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition:</p>

            <p class="que">The repeated phrase "I can't" emphasizes the young seagull's fear and initial resistance to

            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The entire concept of the black aeroplane itself could be seen as a metaphor.
                It's a physical plane, but it also represents the unknown, the element of mystery and even the
                possibility of the supernatural that guides the pilot through the storm.</p>

            <p class="que"># Simile: There might be instances where the pilot compares the storm's intensity or the
                disorientation he feels to something else. For example, "The cockpit spun like a top" or "The rain
                lashed against the windshield like a thousand tiny fists."</p>

            <p class="que"># Symbolism: The storm itself can be seen as a symbol of the pilot's internal struggle. His
                fear and uncertainty are mirrored by the turbulence and darkness of the weather.</p>

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne felt that paper had more patience than people to listen to her plight. So, it was easier for
                her to write all kind of thoughts which she had in her mind. Her personal diary was not meant for any
                one else to read.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Why does Anne provide a brief sketch of her life?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By providing the brief sketch of her life, Anne wants to give an overview of her family, relatives
                and her age. This helps the reader to develop a connection with the author.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. What tells you that Anne loved her grandmother?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">

                close to her Grandmother. She writes in her diary . “No one knows how often I think of her and still
                love her”. On her 13th birthday by lightening up one candle for Grandmother she shows her love for her.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. Why was Mr Keesing annoyed with Anne? What did he ask her to do?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mr Keesing was annoyed with Anne because she was very talkative. He punished her by giving her
                extra homework to write essays to keep her silent and the topics always related to her nature.

            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.7. How did Anne justify her being a chatterbox in her essay?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne justified her being a chatterbox in her essay by explaining that it is due to her mother who
                was also very talkative and nobody could do anything about their inherited traits.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.8. Do you think Mr Keesing was a strict teacher?

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. No, Mr Keesing was not a bad or strict teacher because a teacher did something for the welfare of
                his students. Any teacher would be annoyed if children keep on talking in the class. Secondly, if he had
                been strict he would not have laughed at Anne’s funny arguments.
            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.9. What made Mr Keesing allow Anne to talk in class?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 54)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Was Anne right when she Said that the world would not be interested in the musings of a 13 year
                old girl?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Yes, Anne was right when she said so because most of the people don’t want to give importance to a
                child’s perspective toward the world because they are too immature for the world. But Anne Frank has
                become one of the most discussed of all holocaust victims. Her ‘diary’ has been translated into many
                language.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. There are some examples of diary or journal entries in the ‘Before You Read’ section. Compare
                these with what Anne writes in her diary. What language was the diary originally written in? In what way
                is Anne’s diary different?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne’s diary was entirely different from most of the examples given before the text. It was
                somewhere closer to the memoir in which the name of Raj Kapoor has been mentioned. It was originally
                written in Dutch. It has informal tone which exudes the careful nature of a teenager.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Why does Anne need to give a brief sketch about her family? Does she treat ‘Kitty’ as an insider
                or an outsider?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne gave an introduction of her family in the ‘diary’ because it was hard to make other realise
                that a 13 years old teenager could write about her loneliness. Kitty was an ‘outsider’ which was gifted
                by her parents on her 13th birthday but she considered it her best friend and treated it as an insider.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. How does Anne feel about her father, her grandmother, Mrs Kuperus and Mr Keesing? What do these
                tell you about her?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne has fond of memories of her father, grandmother, Mrs Kuperus and Mr Keesing, who have left
                indelible impressions on her mind and affected her life a lot. The way she represents all of them in her
                diary reveals that Anne was very good at understanding people and at developing interpersonal relations.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. What does Anne write in her first essay?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mr Keesing asked her to write an essay on the topic ‘A Chatterbox’ as punishment. In the essay :
                she accepted the drawbacks of being talkative but argued that it was in her genes as her mother was also
                very talkative. It was difficult to give up the habit and it was also a student’s trait. Even Mr Keesing
                laughed at the argument she had given.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. Anne says teachers are most unpredictable. Is Mr Keesing unpredictable?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne took perfect example of Mr Keesing as an unpredictable teacher because Mr Keesing seemed to be
                indifferent towards Annes’ behaviour. Earlier he laughed but later he allowed Anne to talk in the class
                post reading her essays.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.7. What do these statements tell you about Anne Frank as a person?
                1. We don’t seem to be able to get any closer and that’s the problem. Maybe it’s my fault that we don’t
                confide in each other.
                2. I don’t want, to jcft; down the facts in this diary the way most people would, but I want the diary
                to be my friend.
                3. Margot went to Holland in December and I followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table
                as a birthday present for Margot.
                4. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but
                teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on Earth.
                5. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with
                convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. 1. Anne is reserved.
                2. She is self-confident and inventive.
                3. She is humorous as well.

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 4 - " FROM THE DAIRY OF ANNE FRANK " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Anne might occasionally use similes for vivid comparisons. For example, "The air in
                the stuffy attic felt as thick as soup."</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: She might use metaphors to express complex emotions or situations. For example,
                "The war is a dark cloud hanging over our lives."</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: She could give human qualities to inanimate objects. For example, "The
                clock ticked loudly, mocking the slow pace of our days in hiding."</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: This is a more likely device. Anne might use descriptive language to create a
                picture in the reader's mind. For example, "Looking out the window, I saw the sun glinting off the
                rooftops, a reminder of the world outside our secret prison."</p>

            <p class="que">Question 2. Is bread-making still popular in Goa? How do you know?</p>
            <div class="ans">
                Yes, bread making is still popular in Goa. This is very clear from the narrator’s statement that the
                eaters have gone away leaving the makers behind. There are mixers, moulders and the ones who bake the
                loaves. The time tested furnaces still exist there.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 3. What is the baker called?</p>
            <div class="ans">
                The baker is called a pader in Goa.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 4. When would the baker come everyday? Why did the children run to meet him?</p>
            <div class="ans">
                The baker would come twice a day—once early in the morning and the second time when he returned after
                selling his stuff. The children would run to meet him as they wanted to have bread-bangles.

                <li>for Christmas? – sandwiches</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="ans">
                1. as marriage gifts – sweet bread called bol<br>

            <div class="ans">
                1. The bakers were usually dressed up in a peculiar dress called kabai. It was a single piece long frock
                reaching down to the knees.<br>
                2. During his childhood days, the author saw the bakers wearing a shirt and trousers which were shorter
                than full length ones and longer than half pants.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 7. Who invites the comment – “he is dressed like a pader” Why?</p>
            <div class="ans">
                Any person who is wearing a half pant which reaches just below the knees invites this comment. This is
                because the baker, known as a pader, used to dress like that.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 8. Where were the monthly accounts of the baker recorded?</p>
            <div class="ans">
                Monthly accounts of the baker were recorded on some wall in the house with a pencil.

                necessary to have bread for every occasion, making the presence of a baker’s furnace in the village very

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                The story takes us back to the narrator's childhood in Goa, during the time of Portuguese influence.
                Bread, especially loaves baked in large furnaces, was a staple food. The narrative emphasizes the
                significance of bakers, called paders, in Goan culture. Their role transcended simply providing bread;
                they were ingrained in the daily life of the community.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>The Enchanting Arrival of the Baker</strong><br>
                The author reminisces about the baker's twice-daily visits. The first visit involved selling fresh
                loaves, a delightful event for the children. The sound of the baker's bamboo stick served as a wake-up
                call, even more exciting than breakfast, as children rushed to meet him, often without even brushing
                their teeth.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>A Friend and Delights for Children</strong><br>
                The baker wasn't just a bread vendor; he was a friendly presence for the children. He offered special
                treats – bread bangles or "kankon" – made especially for them, adding to the joy of his arrival.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Loaves for the Household and the Enduring Bakery Business</strong><br>
                Adults typically didn't interact with the baker directly. Loaves were usually purchased by maidservants
                for household consumption, often enjoyed with tea. The story highlights the various uses of bread in
                Goan life, including sweet bread called Bol, a vital part of weddings, and its role in making cakes and
                sandwiches. The baker's attire, a unique knee-length frock called a "kabai," is also mentioned.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>A Glimpse into a Fading Tradition</strong><br>
                The passage subtly hints at a changing Goa. While the baker's profession remains a profitable one, the
                tradition of the distinctive loaves and the "kabai" dress might be fading.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Enduring Legacy</strong><br>
                The story concludes by celebrating the enduring legacy of bakers in Goa. Though the Portuguese era may
                have ended, the baker's presence continues to be a cherished part of Goan life and culture.

                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                The chapter "Coorg," from the textbook excerpt "Glimpses of India," dives into the beauty and unique
                characteristics of Coorg, a district in Karnataka, India.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Enchanting Landscape</strong><br>
                The passage paints a picture of Coorg as a place of idyllic charm. Lush evergreen forests blanket the
                hills, while coffee plantations and spice gardens add a touch of aroma and visual intrigue. The author
                compares Coorg to heaven, emphasizing its pleasant climate, especially between September and March,
                which makes it a popular tourist destination.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Coffee Culture</strong><br>
                Coffee is deeply ingrained in Coorg's identity. The text mentions the pervasiveness of the coffee aroma
                in the air, highlighting its significance.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>The Coorg People</strong><br>
                The Coorg people, also known as Kodavas, are another aspect that the chapter explores. The passage
                mentions a theory suggesting their possible Greek or Arabic descent, linked to a story about Alexander's
                army settling there. Their distinct attire, the long black coat called Kuppia, is also noted. More
                importantly, the chapter emphasizes the Coorg people's bravery. Their well-deserved reputation is
                reflected in the famous Coorg Regiment of the Indian Army, and the fact that India's first army chief,
                General Cariappa, hailed from Coorg.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Geographical Significance</strong><br>
                The Coorg region plays a vital role in the water supply, with its hills and forests acting as the source
                for the Cauvery River, a lifeline for many areas.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                Overall, "Coorg" offers a glimpse into a captivating place in India, known for its stunning natural
                beauty, rich coffee culture, and the valiant Coorg people.

                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                The chapter "Tea from Assam," which is part of a larger work titled "Cleanliness of India," tells the
                story of two friends, Pranjol and Rajvir. Pranjol, originally from Assam, invites his classmate Rajvir
                to visit his home during the summer break.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Journey and Tea Facts</strong><br>
                Their journey by train becomes an exploration of the world of tea. As they sip chai, Rajvir reveals a
                surprising fact: over 80 crore cups of tea are consumed globally every day! This sparks a conversation
                about the history and origins of tea.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Legends of Tea</strong><br>
                Rajvir shares two interesting legends. One is a Chinese tale about an emperor who accidentally
                discovered tea when leaves from a burning bush fell into his boiling water. The other is an Indian
                legend about Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk who cut off his eyelids to stay awake during meditation. From
                his discarded eyelids, tea plants are said to have grown.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Arrival at Tea Estate</strong><br>
                Pranjol and Rajvir arrive at Mariani junction and head to Dhekibari Tea Estate, managed by Pranjol's
                father. Here, they witness firsthand the process of tea plucking, with women using bamboo baskets to
                collect the fresh leaves.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                The chapter is a delightful blend of travelogue, history lesson, and cultural exploration. It paints a
                vivid picture of Assam's tea plantations and the significance of tea in our daily lives. While the title
                "Cleanliness of India" might seem unrelated, this chapter focuses on a different kind of "cleanliness" -
                the fresh, invigorating experience of a cup of tea.

                What ‘experiment’ did Maxwell think Camusfearna would be suitable for?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                The writer had gone to Southern Iraq in the year 1956. He took a fancy to the idea that instead of
                keeping a dog as a pet, he would go for an otter. Camusfearna was surrounded by water, so it would be an
                eminently suitable spot for this experiment.

                Answer:<br>
                The otter was named by zoologists as Lutrogale Perspicillata Maxwelli. Hence, it was called Maxwell’s

                Answer:<br>
                When the author first took Mijbil to the bathroom, the otter first went wild with joy in the water. He
                plunged and rolled in it. He jumped up and down the length of the bathtub. He made enough slosh and
                splash. After two days, the otter suddenly disappeared and went to the bathroom to play in the water and
                opened the tap on his own.

                Answer:<br>
                Mijbil was packed in a box as the airlines had directed the author. As British airlines did not allow
                pets on board the author had to book a ticket on a different airline from Iraq to Paris and then Paris

                The box was lined with a metal sheet. Mij didn’t feel comfortable in the box and tried to escape. In his
                attempt to escape, Mij tore into the metal lining of the box and in the process hurt himself.

                Answer:<br>
                As there was no other way to carry Mij to London, Maxwell put him in the box again. He must have felt
                pity on the way the otter hurt himself. Moreover, he must be worried as well.

                Answer:<br>
                The airhostess was very sympathetic after listening to Maxwell’s story. She understood how he might be
                feeling and then gave him permission to take the otter out of the box. Due to all this, Maxwell referred

                Mij invented a game of playing with the ball in a unique way. One of the author’s suitcase was damaged

                1. school children<br>
                2. Mij?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                Compulsive habits are usually strange acts or behaviors which a person does without a clear reason. For
                example, a cricket player may put on his right shoes first as he believes it would bring him good luck,
                or a kid jumping over a fence instead of going through the passageway. Usually, compulsive behavior of
                children is full of childhood mischief, and those of adults are of the incorrigible type.<br>
                1. As per this story, children must place their feet squarely on the center of each paving block; must
                touch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or pass to the outside of every second lamp post.<br>
                2. Mijbil while on its way home would jump over the boundary wall railing and run at full speed

                Answer:<br>
                Otters belong to a comparatively small group of animals called Mustellines, shared by badger, mongoose,
                weasel, stoat, mink, and others. They are found in large numbers in marshes. Arabs keep them as pets and
                tame them. Otters love to spread water and splash in it. Maxwell’s otter was of a race previously
                unknown to science and was at length named by zoologists Lutrogale Perspicillata Maxwelli.

            <p class="que">Loneliness and a New Companion</p>

            <p class="que">The story opens with Gavin Maxwell, the author, feeling lonely after the loss of his pet
                dog.<br>
                Travelling in Iraq, he expresses a desire for a new pet to fill the void.<br>
                A friend suggests an unconventional pet - an otter from the Tigris River marshes.</p>

            <p class="que">Meeting Mijbil</p>

            <p class="que">Upon reaching their destination, the author receives an unexpected gift - a baby otter
                delivered in a sack!<br>
                He christens the otter Mijbil, or Mij for short.</p>

            <p class="que">Challenges and Journey</p>

            <p class="que">Taking Mijbil back to London proves to be a challenge. Airlines have strict no-pet
                policies.<br>
                The author resorts to transporting Mij in a small box, leading to a chaotic situation when Mij escapes
                mid-flight.<br>
                Fortunately, with the help of a kind air hostess, the author and Mij manage to reach London safely.</p>

            <p class="que">Life with Mij</p>

            <p class="que">The story depicts Mij's playful personality and his fascination with toys.<br>
                The author describes the unique challenges and joys of having an otter as a pet.<br>
                The chapter concludes without revealing the specifics of Mij's life in the author's London flat, leaving
                the reader curious about their future adventures.</p>

            <p class="que">Themes</p>

            <p class="que">The story explores themes of companionship, overcoming challenges, and the unique bond
                between humans and animals.<br>
                It also provides a glimpse into the playful nature of otters.</p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Playful:</strong><br>
                The story highlights Mijbil's love for games and toys. He enjoys juggling objects on his back and has a
                particular fascination with marbles.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Curious:</strong><br>
                Mijbil's inquisitive nature is evident in his exploration of his surroundings and his attempts to
                interact with new objects.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Affectionate:</strong><br>
                Despite being a wild animal, Mijbil forms a bond with Maxwell, seeking comfort by nuzzling him.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Destructive:</strong><br>
                Mijbil's playful nature can sometimes be destructive, as seen when he tries to tear through his travel
                box, injuring himself.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Unruly:</strong><br>
                As a wild animal, Mijbil is not fully domesticated and exhibits unpredictable behaviour.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>The Wild vs. Domestic:</strong><br>
                The story explores the inherent conflict between Mijbil's wild instincts and the attempt to keep him as
                a pet. This creates a dynamic where some of Mijbil's behaviours, natural for an otter in the wild,
                become disruptive in a domestic setting.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Overall:</strong><br>
                Mijbil is a charming and energetic character who embodies the playful spirit of otters. The story
                explores the challenges and joys of caring for an unusual pet, highlighting Mijbil's unique personality.

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 6 - " Mijbil the Otter " ]</span>
            <p class="que"><strong>Simile:</strong><br>
                The story might use similes to describe Mijbil's playful actions. For instance, it could compare the way
                Mijbil juggles objects to a skilled performer, like "He balanced the ping-pong ball on his nose with the
                dexterity of a circus seal."
            </p>

            <p class="que"><strong>Figurative Language in Descriptions:</strong><br>
                The use of descriptive language itself can be considered a poetic device. The chapter might depict
                Mijbil's appearance using evocative words, like his "sleek, dark fur" or his "bright, inquisitive eyes."
            </p>

            <p class="que"><strong>Personification:</strong><br>
                The story might occasionally use personification to describe Mijbil's actions or emotions. For example,
                it could describe Mij nuzzling the author as "offering a comforting hug."

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                What was Valli’s favourite pastime?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli’s favourite pastime was standing in the front doorway of her house and looking at the
                street outside.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                What was the source of unending joy for Valli? What was her strongest desire?</p>
            <div class="ans">The sight of the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town, filled each
                time with a new set of passengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli. Her strongest desire was to
                ride the bus.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                What did Valli find out about the bus journey? How did she find these details?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli found out that the bus journey to the town took 45 minutes and the one-way fare cost
                30 paisa. She listened carefully to the conversations between her neighbours and people who regularly
                used the bus and asked a few discreet questions here and there. This way she picked up various small
                details about the bus journey.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                What do you think Valli was planning to do?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli was planning to go to the town and then return back by the same bus. The fare was 30
                paise one way and the ride took forty-five minutes. In this way, she planned that she would be back by
                2:45 pm if she took the bus at 1:00 pm.</div>

            <p class="que">Page 122</p>

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                Why does the conductor call Valli ‘madam’?</p>
            <div class="ans">The conductor called Valli ‘madam’ because she behaved like a woman. She declined his help
                and was very quick in her answers to the conductor’s questions. This made the conductor call her madam.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                Why does Valli stand up on the seat? (or) What does she see now?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli wanted to look outside the bus. She found her view blocked by the canvas blind that
                covered the lower part of the window. In order to have a better view, she stood up on the seat and
                peered over the blind. She saw a canal, palm trees, grassland, mountains, green fields, and the sky.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                What does Valli tell the elderly man when he calls her a child?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli replied that there was nobody in the bus who was a child. She told him that she had
                paid her fare of 30 paise like everyone else.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                Why didn’t Valli want to make friends with the elderly woman?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli did not want to make friends with the elderly woman because she looked quite
                repulsive. She had big earholes and was wearing ugly earrings. Apart from this, she was chewing betel
                and her mouth was also filled with betel juice.</div>

            <p class="que">Page 125</p>

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                How did Valli save money for her first journey? Was it easy for her?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli had very painstakingly saved every stray coin that came her way by resisting every
                temptation to buy peppermints, toys, balloons, etc. It had been very difficult for her. Even at the
                village fair, she resisted the temptation to be on the merry-go-round. Thus, she had been able to save
                sixty paise for her first bus journey.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                What did Valli see on her way that made her laugh?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli saw a young cow, tail high in the air, running very fast right in the middle of the
                road in front of the bus. The driver sounded his horn again and again so that the cow would move away.
                But the more he honked, the more frightened the animal became and faster it galloped. This all seemed
                very funny to Valli and she laughed and laughed till there were tears in her eyes.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                Why didn’t she get off the bus at the bus station?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli had planned that she only wanted to ride on the bus. She would spend thirty paise on
                her fare, go to the town, and then come back by the same bus before her mother woke up. She didn’t have
                time or money to go to see the town.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                Why didn’t Valli want to go to the stall to have a drink? What does this tell you about her?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli had saved only sixty paise for the trip. She didn’t want to waste any money on the
                drink as she had to come back by the same bus at any cost. So, when the conductor suggested she get down
                and have a drink, she refused. He offered to bring one for her, but she still refused. This shows that
                she was a well-mannered girl.</div>

            <p class="que">Thinking About The Text (Page 127)</p>

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                What was Valli’s deepest desire? Find the words and phrases in the story that tell you this.</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli’s deepest desire was to go on a bus ride. The words and phrases in the story that
                tell this are ‘source of unending joy’, ‘stare wistfully’, and ‘kindle in her longings, dreams and
                hopes’.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                How did Valli plan her bus ride? What did she find out about the bus, and how did she save up the fare?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">Over many days and months, Valli listened carefully to conversations between her neighbours
                and people who regularly used the bus and asked a few discreet questions here and there. She came to
                know that the town was six miles from her village, the bus fare was thirty paise, and the bus trip took
                forty-five minutes. She also thought that if she stayed on the bus and came back by the same bus, it
                would only cost her sixty paise. She painstakingly saved each and every penny she got, resisting all
                temptation to buy peppermints, toys, etc., and even a ride on the merry-go-round at the village annual
                fair so as to save sixty paise. It was a secret trip which she had planned without the knowledge of her
                parents.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                What kind of person is Valli? To answer this question, pick out the following sentences from the text
                and fill in the blanks. The words you fill in are the clues to your answer.</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli was a confident girl who did not think that her age was a limitation to her
                travelling alone to the town. She considered herself a grown-up and acted like one.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                Why does the conductor refer to Valli as ‘Madam’?</p>
            <div class="ans">The conductor called Valli ‘Madam’ as she behaved like a grown-up and did not think that
                she was a child. She also refused his help and told him that she could manage on her own.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 5:<br>
                Find the lines in the text which tell you that Valli was enjoying her ride on the bus.</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli thoroughly enjoyed her ride in the bus. The following lines from the text tell us
                about it. She saw so many things on her way—a canal, palm trees, grasslands, distant mountains. “Oh! it
                was all so wonderful,” that’s what she felt. “Sometimes the bus seemed on the point of gobbling up
                another vehicle that was coming towards them or a pedestrian crossing the road. Somehow it passed
                smoothly, leaving all obstacles behind,” and then she saw a cow running very fast in front of the bus.
                This all seemed very funny to Valli and she laughed and laughed till tears flowed from her eyes.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 6:<br>
                Why does Valli refuse to look out of the window on her way back?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli refused to look out of the window on her way back as she saw the dead body of the cow
                who was running towards the bus when she was going to town. This made her sad and frightened.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 7:<br>
                What does Valli mean when she says… “I was just agreeing with you what you said about things happening
                without our knowledge”?</p>
            <div class="ans">While making this statement, Valli was trying to hide the fact about her bus ride. She was
                also feeling elated at making a successful attempt at her plan.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 8:<br>
                The author describes the things that Valli sees from an 8-year-old’s point of view. Can you find
                evidence from the text for his statement?</p>
            <div class="ans">Yes, for example when the author says, ‘she was fascinated by the bus’ and ‘watching the
                bus fill with a new set of people each time was a source of unending joy for her’. When the author
                describes the bus, he stresses on the colour and look of the new bus ‘like silver’ because a child

                    helping her mother with chores to collecting fallen mangoes. She even devises clever ways to save,
                    like hiding a paisa (a small denomination coin) whenever she receives it for buying groceries.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Planning the Adventure:</strong><br>
                    Valli knows her mother wouldn't allow her to travel alone. So, she meticulously plans her trip for a
                    day when her mother wakes up late for her afternoon nap. She packs a small bag with essentials like
                    peanuts and a water bottle, feeling a thrill of excitement and nervousness.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>The Big Day Arrives:</strong><br>
                    The much-anticipated day dawns. Valli wakes up early, dressed in her best clothes, and waits
                    anxiously for the bus. When it arrives, she gathers her courage, boards the bus, and pays the fare
                    with her hard-earned savings.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>A World Unfolds:</strong><br>
                    The journey itself is a revelation for Valli. She watches the unfamiliar sights and landscapes
                    unfold before her, filled with wonder. She observes the passengers—a crying baby, an old woman
                    chewing betel nut, a group of men discussing politics. Each scene adds to her growing understanding
                    of the world.
                </p>
                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Reaching the Town:</strong><br>
                    The bus arrives at the town, a bustling place with shops, markets, and towering buildings. Valli
                    steps off, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. Although she doesn't venture far, she experiences a
                    sense of accomplishment and independence.
                </p>
                <p class="que">
                    <strong>A Race Against Time:</strong><br>
                    Remembering her mother, Valli knows she must return before her nap is over. She boards the return
                    bus, her mind buzzing with the day's experiences. Back in her village, she sneaks back home,
                    relieved and exhilarated by her secret adventure.
                </p>
                <p class="que">
                    <strong>A Changed Perspective:</strong><br>
                    Valli's bus ride marks a turning point. She now sees the world beyond her village as a place of
                    possibilities. Her experience fosters a sense of self-reliance and a thirst for further exploration.
                    The story ends with a hint that Valli might embark on more such adventures in the future.

                    <strong>Valliammai (Valli):</strong><br>
                    Curious and Adventurous: Valli's defining trait is her insatiable curiosity about the world beyond
                    her village. She is fascinated by the bus and the stories of the town, fueling her desire for
                    adventure.<br><br>
                    Observant and Resourceful: Valli is a keen observer, gathering information about the bus route,
                    timings, and fare. She is resourceful, saving every penny and devising clever ways to accumulate
                    money for her trip.<br><br>
                    Independent and Determined: Valli understands the need for independence and plans her adventure
                    meticulously. Her determination to experience the world on her own terms is admirable.<br><br>
                    Naïve and Innocent: Despite her resourcefulness, Valli's age shines through in her plan to avoid
                    detection during her trip.
                </p>

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Valli's Mother (Unnamed):</strong><br>
                    Hardworking and Caring: Though not directly portrayed, Valli's mother is likely hardworking, looking
                    after the household and providing for Valli. Her caring nature is evident in Valli's desire not to
                    worry her mother with her solo trip.
                </p>

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Other Characters:</strong><br>
                    The story features a cast of minor characters on the bus, offering glimpses into the wider
                    world:<br><br>
                    Crying Baby: Represents the innocence and vulnerability of childhood.<br><br>
                    Betel Nut Chewing Woman: Represents a glimpse into local customs and habits.<br><br>
                    Men Discussing Politics: Represents the adult world and its concerns, contrasting with Valli's
                    perspective.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Overall:</strong><br>
                    The characters in "Madam Rides the Bus" serve to highlight Valli's journey of self-discovery and her
                    yearning for a world beyond her immediate surroundings.

                <p class="que"><strong>Simile:</strong><br>
                    While not explicitly stated, the poem might use similes to depict Valli's observations. For
                    instance, it could compare the way the bus travels to a "lumbering yellow giant" or describe the
                    passengers' chatter as "a buzzing hive of voices."


                    "
                </p>

                <p class="que"><strong>Metaphor:</strong><br>
                    The title itself, "Madam Rides the Bus," can be considered a metaphor. "Madam" is a term of respect
                    typically used for older women, contrasting with Valli's young age. This metaphor highlights Valli's
                    desire to be seen as independent and grown-up.
                </p>

                <p class="que"><strong>Personification:</strong><br>
                    The poem might use personification to describe inanimate objects. For instance, it could describe
                    the bus "winking" its headlights or the road "stretching out" before Valli. This technique
                    personalizes the experience and adds a touch of wonder.

                <p class="que">Question 1.
                    When her son dies, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house? What does she ask for? Does she get it? Why
                    not?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    After the death of her only son, Kisa Gotami was overcome with grief. She carried the dead body of
                    her son in her arms and went from door to door asking for medicine to cure her child, but nobody
                    could provide any medicine. For there is no such medicine available which can bring a dead person
                    back to life.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 2.
                    Kisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the Buddha. What does she ask for?
                    Does she get it? Why not?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Gautama Buddha asks Kisa to bring a handful of mustard seeds from a house where death had never
                    knocked at the door. Kisa Gotami went from door to door, but couldn’t find a single house where
                    death had not taken a beloved away. She could not get it as death is inevitable and anyone who is
                    born is bound to die one day.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 3.
                    What does Kisa Gotami understand the second time that she failed to understand the first time? Was
                    this what Buddha wanted her to understand?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    After failing to procure a handful of mustard seeds from a house where death had never knocked at
                    the door, she sat down by the roadside feeling helpless. She saw the lights of the city that
                    flickered and were extinguished. At last, it was darkness everywhere. She realised that death was
                    common to all and she was being selfish in her grief. Yes, this is what Buddha wanted her to
                    understand, that everyone who is born has to die one day.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 4.
                    Why do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In what way did Buddha change her
                    understanding?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Earlier, she could see only her grief. When she went from door to door the second time, she
                    understood that everyone was dealing with the loss of a beloved one. There was not a single house in
                    the town where death had not taken a father, a mother, a sister, a brother, son or a daughter.
                    Everyone, at some point or the other, has experienced the death of their loved ones. Gautama Buddha
                    helped her to understand all this, as he told her to bring a handful of mustard seeds from a house
                    where death had never knocked at the door. This way she became aware that death is common to all
                    human beings.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 5.
                    How do you usually understand the idea of selfishness? Do you agree with Kisa Gotami that she was
                    being selfish in her grief?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    A selfish person is one who only thinks about himself or herself, and to some extent, Kisa Gotami
                    was being selfish because we are humans and it is natural for us to die. We do not easily accept the
                    death of our loved ones. The same has happened with Kisa Gotami. As it was her only child, she did
                    not want him to die and finally went to Buddha to ask for help.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
                postmaster.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.
                Compassionate and Kind: Moved by Lencho's faith, he rallies the office to help anonymously.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

                Compassionate: They contribute money, demonstrating their willingness to help those in need.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

                Represents Faith and Hope: While not a physical character, God embodies the concept of faith as a source
                of hope and the belief in a higher power's intervention.</pre>

                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1.
                    What does Chubukov at first suspect that Lomov has come for? Is he sincere when he later says ‘And
                    I’ve always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son”? Find reasons for your answer from the
                    play.</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    At first, Chubukov suspected that Lomov had come to borrow money as he was in his evening dress. He
                    was not sincere when he told Lomov that he had always loved him and that he was like his own son
                    because he had decided not to give any money to Lomov. It was only when Lomov asked for his
                    daughter’s hand in marriage that his attitude changed and he rushed out to call his daughter,
                    Natalya.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 2.
                    Chubukov says of Natalya: “……. as if she won’t consent! She’s in love; egad, she’s like a lovesick
                    cat……” Would you agree? Find reasons for your answer.</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Yes, Natalya is in love. This is clear by the way she behaves when she gets to know that Lomov came
                    to propose to her. She starts weeping and asks her father to bring Lomov at once.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 3.
                    1. Find all the words and expressions in the play that the characters use to speak about each other,
                    and the accusations and insults they hurl at each other. (For example, Lomov in the end calls
                    Chubukov an intriguer; but earlier, Chubukov has himself called Lomov a “malicious, double-faced
                    intriguer.” Again, Lomov begins by describing Natalya as “an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking,
                    well-educated.”)</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    The words and expressions that have been used to describe each other by various characters of the
                    play are:
                    - Chubukov: intriguer, grabber, old rat
                    - Natalya: a lovesick cat, an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well-educated
                    - Lomov: a good neighbour, impudent, pettifogger, malicious, double-faced intriguer, rascal, blind
                    hen, turnip ghost, a villain, scarecrow, stuffed sausage, etc.
                </div>

                <p class="que">2. Then think of five adjectives or adjectival expressions of your own to describe each
                    character in the play.</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    - Chubukov: conniving, quick-tempered, insincere, opportunistic, manipulative
                    - Natalya: emotional, impulsive, passionate, naive, stubborn
                    - Lomov: nervous, indecisive, courteous, sensitive, excitable
                </div>

                <p class="que">3. Can you now imagine what these characters will quarrel about next?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Given their personalities and the nature of their previous quarrels, it is likely that these
                    characters will quarrel about something trivial yet emotionally charged, such as the boundaries of
                    their properties, the quality of their livestock, or perhaps a misunderstanding about a social event
                    or family matter.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
                postmaster.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.
                Compassionate and Kind: Moved by Lencho's faith, he rallies the office to help anonymously.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

                Compassionate: They contribute money, demonstrating their willingness to help those in need.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

                Represents Faith and Hope: While not a physical character, God embodies the concept of faith as a source
                of hope and the belief in a higher power's intervention.</pre>

                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>

                <div class="ans">
                    Mrs Pumphrey is worried about Tricki because he is unwell. He has refused to eat food and had bouts
                    of vomiting. She feels that he is suffering from a serious health issue such as malnutrition.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 2.<br>What does she do to help him? Is she wise in this?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Mrs Pumphrey starts giving him extra snacks like malt, cod-liver oil, and Horlicks, apart from his
                    main meals, to improve his condition. She also continues to satisfy his sweet tooth with cream cakes
                    and chocolates. She does not give him any exercise, considering his listlessness as well. She is not
                    wise in doing so because overfeeding Tricki is worsening his condition instead of improving it. It
                    has made him very fat and lazy.

                <div class="ans">
                    No, the narrator is not as rich as Tricki’s mistress, Mrs. Pumphrey. We can say so because the
                    narrator seems fascinated by how lavishly Mrs. Pumphrey spends on the well-being and maintenance of
                    her pet. He is unusually surprised by the enriching items she sends for Tricki, as he cannot afford
                    them for himself.

                <div class="ans">
                    James Herriot treats Tricki just like he would treat an overweight and lazy dog, which Tricki is. He
                    cuts down his food intake and keeps him under strict observation for the initial days at the
                    hospital. He gradually increases Tricki’s food and sets him free for physical activities to improve
                    his health.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 6.<br>Why is he tempted to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Mr. Herriot is tempted to keep Tricki on as a permanent guest because of the good food and wine he
                    is enjoying in Tricki’s name. He does not want to lose the luxurious inflow of fresh eggs, wine, and
                    brandy.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 7.<br>Why does Mrs Pumphrey think the dog’s recovery is ‘a triumph of surgery’?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Mrs. Pumphrey thinks that Tricki’s recovery is a triumph of surgery because his illness was very
                    serious. She was of the opinion that there were very few chances of Tricki to improve and he needed
                    immediate medical attention. Thus, his revival without any medicinal treatment was a great
                    achievement, according to her.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Think About It<br>(Page 6)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1.<br>What kind of a person do you think the narrator, a veterinary surgeon, is?
                    Would you say he is tactful as well as full of common sense?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    The narrator, a veterinary surgeon, is a capable and wise doctor. He handles Tricki properly, which
                    shows that he is sincere about his profession.<br>He does not operate upon the dog unnecessarily and
                    cures him by altering his diet and activities.<br>He is a tactful person as he knew exactly how to
                    convince Mrs. Pumphrey to hospitalize Tricki for surgery. His decision to inform Mrs. Pumphrey to
                    collect Tricki supports his sensibilities even though he was tempted to keep Tricki as a permanent
                    guest.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 2.<br>Do you think Tricki was happy to go home? What do you think will happen
                    now?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Tricki was happy to go back home as he really loved his mistress and the comfort of his lavish life.
                    He didn’t have any friends at home like in the hospital, but he seemed equally excited at the sight
                    of Mrs. Pumphrey. I think that Mrs. Pumphrey will now be careful about Tricki’s diet and health. She
                    may also give him exercise daily as prescribed by the vet earlier.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 3.<br>Do you think it is a real-life episode or mere fiction? Or is it a mixture
                    of both?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    The story seems to be a mixture of both. It may be possible for rich persons to overfeed their pets
                    due to love. It is not unusual for them to maintain a vast wardrobe for them either. But it is
                    unlikely for a veterinary doctor to go out of the way and lie in order to save an animal. It is also
                    unusual for anyone to consume food which is given in the name of a pet’s health.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Talk About It<br>(Page 7)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1.<br>This episode describes the silly behavior of a rich woman who is foolishly
                    indulgent, perhaps because she is lonely. Do you think such people are merely silly or can their
                    actions cause harm to others?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Mrs. Pumphrey’s actions had a harmful reaction on Tricki’s health. She was overparenting and
                    overfeeding Tricki in the name of love. This worsened his condition to an extent that he had to be
                    hospitalized. People like Mrs. Pumphrey are not just merely silly but their actions can definitely
                    have dangerous consequences for others.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 2.<br>Do you think there are also parents like Mrs Pumphrey?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Yes, there are some parents like Mrs. Pumphrey who spoil their children by pampering them. They
                    overfeed their children/pets despite being aware of the harmful effects on their health. Parents
                    like Mrs. Pumphrey should maintain a healthy lifestyle for their family and pets.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 3.<br>What would you have done if you were:<br>

                    <br>1. a member of the staff in Mrs Pumphrey’s household,</br>
                    <br>2. a neighbour? What would your life have been like, in general?</br>

                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    If I were a member of the staff in her household, I would have not followed Mrs. Pumphrey’s command
                    to feed Tricki blindly. Instead, I would have fed him according to the vet’s advice. I would have
                    also skipped sending the unnecessary stuff like toys, cushions, etc., to the hospital. My life would
                    have been very busy, as I would have had to take care of the household chores and meet Tricki’s
                    demands on time.
                </div>

                <div class="ans">
                    If I were Mrs. Pumphrey’s neighbor, I would have advised her to consult a vet and follow his advice
                    strictly, keeping in mind Tricki’s deteriorating health. I would have also been supportive in their
                    hard time when Tricki was hospitalized. My life as Mrs. Pumphrey’s neighbor would have been full of
                    surprises and gifts as Mrs. Pumphrey was a loving lady.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 4.<br>What would you have done if you were in the narrator’s place?</p>
                <div class="ans">
                    If I were in the narrator’s place, I would have treated Tricki with a similar amount of compassion
                    and love. I would have been equally caring as Mr. James Herriot towards Tricki. I would have just
                    been a little more stern while advising Mrs. Pumphrey to put Tricki on a strict diet knowing her way
                    of showing love. I would have also not consumed Tricki’s share of eggs, wine, and brandy sent by
                    Mrs. Pumphrey.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <p class="que"></p>
                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

            Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.

                <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch1">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A Triumph of Surgery " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Who does ‘I’ refer to in this story?</p>
                <div class="ans">I refers to Hari Singh, the narrator of the story who is a 15-year-old experienced
                    thief.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. What is he “a fairly successful hand” at?</p>
                <div class="ans">He is a fairly successful hand at stealing. He is an experienced thief. He is so clean
                    and swift in his work that he robs people without being caught.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. What does he get from Anil in return for his work?</p>
                <div class="ans">In return for Hari Singh’s work, Anil gives him food and a place to live.</div>

                <p class="que">Page 10</p>

                <p class="que">Question 4. How does the thief think Anil will react to the theft?</p>
                <div class="ans">According to Hari, Anil would be sad not because of the loss of money but because of
                    the loss of trust he had in Hari.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 5. What does he say about the different reactions of people when they are
                    robbed?</p>
                <div class="ans">Hari’s experience at theft had made him aware of differences in reactions of people
                    when they’re robbed. According to him, a greedy man shows fear; the rich, anger, and a poor man,
                    acceptance.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 6. Does Anil realize that he has been robbed?</p>
                <div class="ans">Yes, Anil realized that he had been robbed, as he gave a fifty-rupee note to Hari which
                    was still damp due to the night’s rain.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 13)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. What are Hari Singh’s reactions at the prospect of receiving an education? Do
                    they change over time? {Hint: compare, for example, the thought: ‘I knew that once I could write
                    like an educated man there would be no limit to what I could achieve’ with these later thoughts:
                    ‘Whole sentences, I knew, could one day bring me more than a few hundred rupees. It was a simple
                    matter to steal and sometimes just as simple to be caught. But to be a really big man, a clever and
                    respected man, was something else.’) What makes him return to Anil?</p>
                <div class="ans">Hari was very happy and grateful when he learned to write his name. He was very excited
                    when Anil promised to teach him to write whole sentences as well. He knew that being an educated man
                    would add to his abilities and he could achieve anything. But when he left Anil’s house, he realized
                    that stealing was simply a crime to indulge himself but being educated was an entirely different
                    thing. He knew the respect, reputation, and possibilities that would come to him once he was
                    educated. And so his urge to receive education compelled him to return to Anil.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Why does Anil not hand the thief over to the police? Do you think most people
                    would have done so? In what ways is Anil different from such employers?</p>
                <div class="ans">Unlike others, Anil does not hand over Hari to the police on theft charges. He knew
                    about the theft but he did not thrash him nor even mention it in front of Hari. He was glad that
                    Hari had realized his mistake and the importance of education in life. Anil wanted Hari to become a
                    literate man and lead a respectful life. He is different from other such employers because he is
                    very understanding. Hari’s return gave him the hope of a change in him.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Do you think people like Anil and Hari Singh are found only in fiction, or
                    are there such people in real life?</p>
                <div class="ans">People like Anil and Hari Singh are found only in fiction. Though exceptions might be
                    there, these people are rarely found. Anil was a kind and considerate person who was concerned about
                    Hari’s education and future. And Hari was a thief whose heart changes after realizing the importance
                    of education for his future. People like these are imaginary in today’s world.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Do you think it is a significant detail in the story that Anil is a
                    struggling writer? Does this explain his behaviour in any way?</p>
                <div class="ans">Yes, it is a significant detail that Anil is a struggling writer. His lifestyle was
                    simple and he used to spend according to his pocket at all times. His struggle sometimes gave him a
                    lot of income while at other times he used to worry about the next payment. Hari’s observation about
                    the discontinuation in his work justifies his behavior regarding money.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. Have you met anyone like Hari Singh? Can you think and imagine the
                    circumstances that can turn a fifteen-year-old boy into a thief?</p>
                <div class="ans">No, I haven’t met anyone like Hari Singh but the existence of such people is certain. A
                    fifteen-year-old boy can be forced by circumstances to become a thief. It may be the need to feed
                    the stomach, to satisfy illegal addiction, to maintain health, to fulfill luxurious demands, etc.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. Where is the story set? (You can get clues from the names of the persons and
                    places mentioned in it). Which language or languages are spoken in these places? Do you think the
                    characters in the story spoke to each other in English?</p>
                <div class="ans">The story is set somewhere in Uttar Pradesh near Lucknow. We can say so because the
                    story mentions that there is a railway station for Express trains to Lucknow. The presence of sweet
                    shops and bazaars also indicates it to be a decent-sized town. No, the characters in the story do
                    not speak to each other in English but probably in Hindi.</div>

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch2">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 2 - " The Thief’s Story " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <p class="que">Read and Find Out (Page 14)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. How is Ausable different from other secret agents? (or) What great qualities
                    made Ausable a successful secret agent? CBSE 2013 (or) How was Ausable different from other secret
                    agents? CBSE 2011 (or) How is Ausable different from other secret agents? How does he deal with Max?
                    CBSE 2012</p>
                <div class="ans">Ausable is different from other secret agents in more ways than one. He has a small
                    room in the musty corridor of a gloomy French hotel. It was on the sixth and top floor and it was
                    scarcely the setting for a romantic adventure. He was extremely fat. In spite of living in Paris for
                    over twenty years, he spoke French and German with difficulty and had an American accent. Instead of
                    getting messages passed secretly to him by beautiful girls, he got only a routine telephone call
                    making an appointment. In these ways, he was different from the conventional notion of a secret
                    agent. He dealt with Max by inventing some stories and convincing Max to act on them, so that he
                    could get rid of Max permanently.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Who is Fowler and what is his first authentic thrill of the day?</p>
                <div class="ans">Fowler is a writer and he had come to meet Ausable. His first authentic thrill of the
                    day came when he saw a man in Ausable’s room pointing a pistol towards Ausable and himself.</div>

                <p class="que">The Midnight Visitor (Page 15)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 3. How has Max got in?</p>
                <div class="ans">Max had got into the room using a passkey or master key.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. How does Ausable say he got in?</p>
                <div class="ans">Ausable said that he thought Max had got into the room through the balcony. He said
                    that it was the second time in a month that somebody had got into his room this way.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 18)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. ‘Ausable did not fit any description of a secret agent Fowler had ever read.”
                    What do secret agents in books and films look like, in your opinion? Discuss in groups or in class
                    some stories or movies featuring spies, detectives, and secret agents, and compare their appearance
                    with that of Ausable in this story. (You may mention characters from fiction in languages other than
                    English. In English fiction, you may have come across Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, or Miss
                    Marple. Have you watched any movies featuring James Bond?)</p>
                <div class="ans">Secret agents in fiction are projected like ideal men, ‘Tall, dark, and handsome’. They
                    are usually well-built and keep beautiful women for company. They would smoke a pipe (like Sherlock
                    Holmes) or a cigar and execute death-defying stunts (like James Bond). Movies based on James Bond
                    show hi-tech gadgets that assist the detective in countering villains. However, there are some
                    exceptions to this appearance of a secret agent also. A character named Feluda was created by
                    Satyajit Ray, the famous Bengali filmmaker. Feluda was a tall athletic figure who relied on his
                    superb analytical ability and observation skills.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. How does Ausable manage to make Max believe that there is a balcony attached
                    to his room? Look back at his detailed description of it. What makes it a convincing story?</p>
                <div class="ans">Ausable creates a detailed description of how his office was part of a bigger apartment
                    and how the next room had a direct connection with a balcony. His statement that somebody else also
                    broke into his office through that balcony earlier made it a convincing story. Ausable’s ability to
                    think quickly and calmly in a situation of panic makes it convincing.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. Looking back at the story, when do you think Ausable thought up his plan for
                    getting rid of Max? Do you think he had worked out his plan in detail right from the beginning? Or
                    did he make up a plan taking advantage of events as they happened?</p>
                <div class="ans">No, I don’t think that he had worked out his plan in detail earlier. He took advantage
                    of events as they happened. Ausable made up a story of the balcony outside the room and as there was
                    a knock at the door, he said that it would be the police. All these made Max desperate. He became
                    restless and without seeing below, jumped out of the window.</div>

                <p class="que">Talk About It (Page 18)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. In this story, Ausable shows great ‘presence of mind’, or the ability to
                    think quickly and act calmly and wisely, in a situation of danger and surprise. Give examples from
                    your own experience, or narrate a story, which shows someone’s presence of mind.</p>
                <div class="ans">This story refers to the play ‘If I Were You’. Gerrard was held hostage by a criminal.
                    However, Gerrard treated the criminal as a guest and trapped him with his confidence. He managed to
                    convince the criminal to run away as the police were behind him. He told the criminal to run through
                    the exit door, which was actually a cupboard door. The criminal exited through the door and was
                    trapped in the cupboard.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Discuss what you would do in the situations described below. Remember that
                    presence of mind comes out of a state of mental preparedness. If you have thought about possible
                    problems or dangers, and about how to act in such situations, you have a better chance of dealing
                    with such situations if they do arise.</p>

                            short-circuit, electricity must be disconnected immediately from everything in the kitchen

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 3 - " The Midnight Visitor " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <p class="que">Read and Find Out (Page 20)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. What does Horace Danby like to collect?</p>
                <div class="ans">Horace Danby likes to collect rare and expensive books.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Why does he steal every year?</p>
                <div class="ans">He stole every year so that he could buy the rare and expensive books that he loved to
                    collect. Each year he planned carefully so as to steal enough to last twelve months.</div>

                <p class="que">Page 22</p>

                <p class="que">Question 3. Who is speaking to Horace Danby?</p>
                <div class="ans">A lady standing in the doorway is speaking to Horace Danby. She was young and pretty
                    and was dressed in red. She said she had come just in time, or else her family would have been
                    robbed by Horace. Thus she pretended to be one of the members of the family living at Shotover
                    Grange.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. Who is the real culprit in the story?</p>
                <div class="ans">The real culprit in the story is the woman who pretended to be a member of the family
                    living at Shotover Grange. She tricked Horace Danby into believing her, and cleverly took away all
                    the jewels that were kept in the safe.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 25)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Did you begin to suspect, before the end of the story, that the lady was not
                    the person Horace Danby took her to be? If so, at what point did you realise this, and how?</p>
                <div class="ans">Yes, we begin to suspect before the end of the story that the lady was not the person
                    Horace Danby took her to be. She was unusually calm on seeing Horace. This seemed strange. When she
                    did not call the police, and instead asked Horace to take out all the jewels from the safe, even if
                    it meant breaking it open, it seems suspicious. Moreover, it seemed highly unlikely that she would
                    forget the number combination to open the safe. Therefore it was evident, before the story ended,
                    that the lady was not the person Horace had taken her to be.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. What are the subtle ways in which the lady manages to deceive Horace Danby
                    into thinking she is the lady of the house? Why doesn’t Horace suspect that something is wrong?</p>
                <div class="ans">Her confident walk, her familiarity with the dog Sherry, her act of touching up her
                    make-up, and the ease with which she picks a cigarette from the right place are enough to deceive
                    anybody. Horace was too frightened to think properly, so he didn’t suspect anything.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. “Horace Danby was good and respectable – but not completely honest”. Why do
                    you think this description is apt for Horace? Why can’t he be categorised as a typical thief?</p>
                <div class="ans">Horace’s habits were not typical of a thief. He was fond of books. He used to steal
                    only once in a year so he was never stealing more than his needs. However, an act of theft is still
                    a crime, no matter how well a thief behaves, so this description is apt for Horace. He can’t be
                    categorised as a typical thief because he is not a regular offender like other thieves.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. Horace Danby was a meticulous planner but still he faltered. Where did he go
                    wrong and why?</p>
                <div class="ans">Horace Danby failed to get enough information about the real occupants of the house. He
                    seems to be too occupied with collecting information about the house map, wiring and location of
                    valuable items. Although he was smart enough to know the dog’s actual name, he overlooked getting
                    information about the occupants of the house. When he landed in trouble with the appearance of the
                    young lady, his clever mind gave way to carelessness, leading him to open the safe without wearing
                    gloves.</div>

                <p class="que">Talk About It (Page 25)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Do you think Horace Danby was unfairly punished, or that he deserved what he
                    got? (or) Do you think Horace Danby was unfairly punished? (CBSE 2013)</p>
                <div class="ans">Horace Danby deserved what he got. A crime is a crime, no matter if it is committed for
                    your own benefit or for somebody else’s benefit.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Do intentions justify actions? Would you, like Horace Danby, do something
                    wrong if you thought your ends justified the means? Do you think that there are situations in which
                    it is excusable to act less than honestly?</p>
                <div class="ans">“Ends do not justify means”, is a very old and time-tested saying. For their own
                    benefit nobody should harm others. But this world doesn’t function on idealism. There are many
                    examples of people tricking people for quick gains. These acts should be deplored and dealt with
                    severely.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 1. How did the invisible man first become visible?</p>
                <div class="ans">The invisible man (Griffin) first became visible after he slipped into a big London
                    store for keeping warm and overslept there while wearing some clothes taken from the store. The
                    clothes made him visible to the shop assistants when the shop opened in the morning. To escape from
                    them, he had to shed all his clothes to become invisible again.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Why was he wandering the streets?</p>
                <div class="ans">Though he was a brilliant scientist, he was a lawless person. His landlord disliked him
                    and wanted to evict Griffin. In revenge, he set fire to the house. To escape, he removed his
                    clothes, becoming invisible. Thus he became homeless and was wandering the streets of London.</div>

                <p class="que">Page 28</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Why does Mrs. Hall find the scientist eccentric?</p>
                <div class="ans">Mrs. Hall found the scientist eccentric because of his strange appearance and also,
                    when she tried to be friendly with him, he rebuffed her by saying that he had come there for
                    solitude and did not wish to be disturbed in his work.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. What curious episode occurs in the study?</p>
                <div class="ans">Very early one morning, a clergyman and his wife were awakened by noises coming from
                    their study. Then they heard the sound of coins being taken from the desk there. However, when they
                    entered the study, they did not find anybody there, which was curious.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. What other extraordinary things happen at the inn?</p>
                <div class="ans">At the inn, Mrs. Hall and her husband went into the scientist’s room on finding its
                    door open. However, he was not seen in the room, but Mrs. Hall heard a sniff and the hat on the
                    bedpost leapt up and dashed into her face. Then the bedroom chair sprang into the air and pushed
                    them both out of the room. This made Mrs. Hall think that her furniture was haunted.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 31)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. “Griffin was rather a lawless person.” Comment.</p>
                <div class="ans">Griffin was not bothered if he had harmed anybody in the fulfilment of what he wanted.
                    He set his landlord’s house on fire because the landlord tried to make him leave. Then his robberies
                    at shops and later in the village indicate that he was a lawless person. When he encountered the
                    landlady of the inn, he threw a chair at her and her husband. Lawless persons like Griffin never
                    think about the safety and well-being of others. They are only concerned about themselves.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. How would you assess Griffin as a scientist?</p>
                <div class="ans">Griffin is a brilliant scientist, as he discovers how to make himself invisible. But he
                    seems to enjoy the feeling of power which he gets out of his invisibility. The power to hurt anybody
                    without getting noticed can give sadistic pleasure to some people. A true scientist should make
                    discoveries for the larger benefit of society, not just for his own benefit.</div>

                <p class="que">Talk About It (Page 31)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Would you like to become invisible? What advantages and disadvantages do you
                    foresee, if you did?</p>
                <div class="ans">It can be an exciting idea for most people. Like two facets of a coin, invisibility can
                    have many advantages and disadvantages. For a child, invisibility may mean a license for all kinds
                    of pranks without getting caught. Like a Hindi movie, invisibility can help you beat all the
                    villains black and blue and get rid of them. Once you become invisible, nobody would notice you.
                    Within no time, the sadness of isolation will take over the excitement of being invisible. You will
                    have no friend. You will tend to behave like the eccentric scientist in this story.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Are there forces around us that are invisible, for example, magnetism? Are
                    there aspects of matter that are ‘invisible’ or not visible to the naked eye? What would the world
                    be like if you could see such forces or such aspects of matter?</p>
                <div class="ans">Magnetic forces and electrostatic forces are examples of invisible forces. The atoms
                    and molecules in a matter are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye. Similarly, heat
                    energy is invisible. Similarly, sound is invisible to us. While the idea of seeing invisible things
                    can be very exciting, their visibility would create too many problems. For example, if we are able
                    to see all the sound around us, that would be too irritating for us.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. What makes glass or water transparent (what is the scientific explanation for
                    this)? Do you think it would be scientifically possible for a man to become invisible, or
                    transparent? (Keep in mind that writers of science fiction have often turned out to be prophetic in
                    their imagination)</p>
                <div class="ans">The fact that light can pass through glass or water makes them transparent. When light
                    falls on an object, the reflected light from that object makes it visible to us. If some device can
                    be made which can prevent reflection of light from the human body then the human body can be made
                    invisible.</div>

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <div class="ans">The book ‘The Travels of Monarch X’ opened the world of science for Richard. After
                    reading it, he became interested in tracking the migration of butterflies. This interest led to his

                    mind. Next is the presence of curiosity. Last but not least, it is the will to do the best and win.
                </div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 38)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. How can one become a scientist, an economist, a historian …? Does it simply
                    involve reading many books on the subject? Does it involve observing, thinking, and doing
                    experiments?</p>
                <div class="ans">Reading many books on a subject is not enough. One must develop the skill of
                    observation and thinking. Experiments need to be done. One needs to have curiosity to explore and
                    find new things. Above all, one must work hard and not get upset by failures.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. You must have read about cells and DNA in your science books. Discuss Richard
                    Ebright’s work in the light of what you have studied. If you get an opportunity to work like Richard
                    Ebright on projects and experiments, which field would you like to work on and why?</p>
                <div class="ans">DNA carry the blueprint of life and heredity. They pass information from one generation
                    to the other. If I get an opportunity to work like Richard Ebright, I would choose to study
                    diseases. By studying the DNA, I may find ways and means to cure many illnesses.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Children everywhere wonder about the world around them. The questions they
                    ask are the beginning of scientific inquiry. Given below are some questions that children in India
                    have asked Prof. Yash Pal and Dr. Rahul Pal as reported in their book, Discovered Questions.
                    (published by NCERT in 2006).</p>

                <p class="que">What is DNA fingerprinting? What are its uses?</p>
                <div class="ans">DNA fingerprinting is a forensic technique used to identify individuals by the
                    characteristics of their DNA. It is used in parentage testing. It is also used in criminal
                    investigation to identify a person or to place him at the scene of a crime.</div>

                <p class="que">How do honeybees identify their own honeycombs?</p>
                <div class="ans">Honeybees have signaling chemicals. They leave trails for fellow honeybees so that they
                    can reach their honeycomb.</div>

                <p class="que">Why does rain fall in drops?</p>
                <div class="ans">The only solid thing in the air are dust particles. Water vapor uses it as a center of
                    attraction when it becomes too heavy. Water vapor condenses on the dust particle as a drop and falls
                    on Earth.</div>

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch6">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. What kind of a person is Mme Loisel and why is she always unhappy?</p>
                <div class="ans">Mme Loisel is a young, pretty, ordinary but discontented woman. She is of a humble
                    background but dreams of riches and comforts. She is proud of her beauty and wants to be admired.
                    Her meager resources are not enough to satisfy her expensive cravings, making her angry all the
                    time.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. What kind of a person is her husband?</p>
                <div class="ans">Her husband, M. Loisel, is an ordinary and average young man. A mere clerk by
                    profession, he is still contented with his job. He is also a caring man, as he is excited to show
                    the dinner invitation to his wife.</div>

                <p class="que">Page 41</p>

                <p class="que">Question 3. What fresh problem now disturbs Mme Loisel?</p>
                <div class="ans">After spending a fortune on a beautiful dress, Mme Loisel is faced with yet another
                    disaster. She frets over the fact that she does not have a beautiful jewel to go with her dress. So,
                    she asks her husband to pass on the invitation to someone else.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. How is the problem solved?</p>
                <div class="ans">Matilda Loisel’s husband, M. Loisel, comes to her rescue. First, he suggests she wear
                    fresh flowers. Matilda mocks the idea. Then, he advises her to borrow some jewels from her rich
                    friend, Mme Forestier. Thus, the problem is solved as Mme Forestier lends her a beautiful diamond
                    necklace.</div>

                <p class="que">Page 42</p>

                <p class="que">Question 5. What do Mr. and Mme Loisel do next?</p>
                <div class="ans">The Loisels leave no stone unturned. M. Loisel goes back and searches for the lost
                    necklace. He then goes to the police and to the cab offices. They also put out an advertisement in
                    the newspapers and offer a reward to anyone who finds the necklace. But, all their efforts go in
                    vain.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 6. How do they replace the necklace?</p>
                <div class="ans">After all other efforts fail, the Loisels decide to buy a new identical necklace to
                    replace the lost one. M. Loisel pooled eighteen thousand francs of his inheritance and borrowed the
                    rest. The couple managed to buy the new necklace for thirty-six thousand francs and returned it to
                    the rightful owner.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 46)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. The course of the Loisel’s life changed due to the necklace. Comment.</p>
                <div class="ans">It takes the Loisels a decade to pay back the money they borrowed to buy the necklace.
                    It changed everything for them. They had to move to the poorest quarters of the city. With no maids
                    or assistance, Matilda had to cook, clean, mend, sew, and bargain with the grocer and butcher to
                    save every sou just for mere survival. The husband had to work in the evening and night to pay their
                    debt. In this way, the course of the Loisel’s life changed due to the necklace.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. What was the cause of Matilda’s ruin? How could she have avoided it?</p>
                <div class="ans">Matilda’s pride and her materialistic aspirations, coupled with her dishonesty, paved
                    the way for her ruin. She could have avoided it by learning to accept her current situation and
                    being content with what she had.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. What would have happened to Matilda if she had confessed to her friend that
                    she had lost her necklace?</p>
                <div class="ans">Truth and honesty would have saved Matilda from her doom. If only she had been
                    courageous enough to confess to her friend the truth about the necklace, she would have learned that
                    it was a fake one that cost a mere five hundred francs. She would not have spent her husband’s
                    entire inheritance and borrowed eighteen thousand francs to pay for its replacement. In fact, she
                    would have saved herself and her husband from ten long years of crushing poverty, misery, and
                    backbreaking labor.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. If you were caught in a situation like this, how would you have dealt with
                    it?</p>
                <div class="ans">Foremost of all, I would have done my best not to become a victim of my own pride and
                    aspirations. If I were caught in such a situation, I would have let the truth out and then faced the
                    consequences. Honesty would have been the way out for me.</div>

                <p class="que">Talk About It (Page 46)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. The characters in this story speak in English. Do you think this is their
                    language? What clues are there in the story about the language its characters must be speaking in?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">Though the characters speak in English, it is not their language. Maupassant wrote the
                    story in French, and it was translated into English. The text provides clues about the French origin
                    of the characters. The names of characters like ‘Mme Loisel, Mme Forestier, and the minister’s name
                    George Ramponneau’ suggest French origins. Additionally, words for currency like ‘Franc’ and ‘Sou’
                    and locations like ‘Palais Royal’ and ‘Champs Elysees’ indicate their French background.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Honesty is the best Policy.</p>
                <div class="ans">Honesty is definitely the best policy. Falsehood and hypocrisy may seem attractive and
                    rewarding at first, but the path they lead on ends in misery, evil, and utter gloom. Honesty, though
                    it may appear challenging in pursuit of material happiness, is the only path to a life of
                    contentment, peace, and lasting happiness.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. We should be content with what life gives us.</p>
                <div class="ans">Life is a great mystery. For every individual, this mystery comes wrapped in a unique
                    package. For some, it includes riches, comfort, name, and fame. For others, it is poverty, anguish,
                    and a constant quest for survival. One should learn to live within one's means and be content with
                    what one has. One may strive to improve their lot through honest means but must ultimately be at
                    peace with what one has achieved.</div>

                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's

                <span>[ NCERT Solutions of CHAPTER : 8 -- " The Hack Driver " ]</span>
                <p class="que">Read and Find Out (Page 47)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Why is the lawyer sent to New Mullion? What does he first think about the
                    place?</p>
                <div class="ans">The lawyer was sent to New Mullion to serve summons on Oliver Lutkins, who was needed
                    as a witness in a law case. He first thinks that the place must be a sweet and simple country
                    village.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Who befriends the lawyer? Where does he take him?</p>
                <div class="ans">A hack driver at the station, who calls himself Bill Magnuson, befriends the lawyer. He
                    tells the lawyer that he knows Lutkins and would help in finding him. Bill takes him to various
                    places where Lutkins was known to hang out, including Fritz’s shop, Gustaff’s barber shop, Gray’s
                    barber shop, the poolroom, and finally to Lutkins’ mother’s farm. However, Oliver Lutkins was not
                    found.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. What does Bill say about Lutkins?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bill tells the lawyer that Lutkins is a hard person to find as he is always busy with
                    various activities. Lutkins owes money to many people, including Bill, and has never repaid anyone.
                    Bill also mentions that Lutkins plays a lot of poker and is skilled at deceiving people.</div>

                <p class="que">Page 50</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. What more does Bill say about Lutkins and his family?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bill tells the lawyer that he knows Lutkins’ mother, who is a terror. He recounts an
                    incident when he took a trunk to her, and she nearly berated him for not handling it carefully. He
                    describes her as very tall, bulky, quick, and talkative. Bill suggests that Lutkins might have gone
                    into hiding at his mother’s place upon learning someone was looking for him.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Does the narrator serve the summons that day?</p>
                <div class="ans">No, the narrator did not serve the summons that day.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. Who is Lutkins?</p>
                <div class="ans">The hack driver himself is Lutkins, pretending to be Bill Magnuson. He tricks the
                    lawyer to avoid being summoned as a witness in a case.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It (Page 53)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. When the lawyer reached New Mullion, did ‘Bill’ know that he was looking for
                    Lutkins? When do you think ‘Bill’ came up with his plan for fooling the lawyer?</p>
                <div class="ans">No, ‘Bill’ did not initially know that the lawyer was looking for Lutkins. He likely
                    came up with his plan for fooling the lawyer when the lawyer mentioned he was searching for Lutkins,
                    as he knew he was required as a witness but did not want to give his testimony.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Lutkins openly takes the lawyer all over the village. How is it that no one
                    lets out the secret? (Hint: Notice that the hack driver asks the lawyer to keep out of sight behind
                    him when they go into Fritz’s.) Can you find other subtle ways in which Lutkins manipulates the
                    tour?</p>
                <div class="ans">Lutkins never allows the lawyer to reach the places where the imaginary Lutkins is
                    supposed to be. He weaves stories about Lutkins’ vagabond nature and uses fear tactics about
                    Lutkins’ mother to fool the lawyer. He prevents the lawyer from asking others about Lutkins and
                    pretends to inquire on the lawyer's behalf, with the villagers playing along with the ruse.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 3. Why do you think Lutkins’ neighbors were anxious to meet the lawyer?</p>
                <div class="ans">Lutkins' neighbors were eager to meet the lawyer because they had heard about Lutkins’
                    prank and wanted to see the gullible man who had been tricked. They were curious to meet the person
                    who had been so easily deceived.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 4. After his first day’s experience with the hack driver, the lawyer thinks of
                    returning to New Mullion to practice law. Do you think he would have reconsidered this idea after
                    his second visit?</p>
                <div class="ans">No, absolutely not. After realizing how Lutkins had tricked him, the lawyer would have
                    certainly reconsidered his idea of returning to New Mullion to practice law.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 5. Do you think the lawyer was gullible? How could he have avoided being taken
                    for a ride?</p>
                <div class="ans">Yes, the lawyer was gullible. He believed everything that Oliver Lutkins (disguised as
                    Bill) said. To avoid being deceived, he should have verified Lutkins' whereabouts with other
                    villagers instead of relying entirely on the hack driver.</div>

                <p class="que">Talk About It (Page 53)</p>

                <p class="que">Question 1. Do we come across persons like Lutkins only in fiction or do we encounter
                    them in real life as well? You can give examples from fiction, or narrate an incident that you have
                    read in the newspaper, or an incident from real life.</p>
                <div class="ans">Persons like Lutkins are found in real life as well. They are not just fictional
                    characters. Newspapers often report on such tricksters. An example from fiction is Uriah Heep from
                    Charles Dickens' 'David Copperfield,' who deceives a wealthy old man and exploits his trust for
                    personal gain.</div>

                <p class="que">Question 2. Who is a ‘con man’, or a confidence trickster?</p>
                <div class="ans">A ‘con man’ or a confidence trickster is a person who deceives others by gaining their
                    trust and then exploiting it to achieve their own ends. They use manipulation and deceit to get what
                    they want from their victims.</div>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose

                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.

                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>

                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's

                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's

                <span>[ NCERT Solutions of CHAPTER : 9 -- " Bholi " ]</span>

                <div class="page">Page 54</div>

                <p class="que">1. Why is Bholi’s father worried about her?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bholi was different from other children. An accident as a child resulted in slight
                    brain damage, and she learned to speak late and stammered. Her face and body were covered with
                    pockmarks. Consequently, her father was concerned about her marriage prospects.</div>

                <p class="que">2. For what unusual reason is Bholi sent to school?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bholi was sent to school mainly to please the Tehsildar, who had instructed Ramlal, her
                    father, to send his daughters to the new school in the village. Ramlal’s wife was against sending
                    girls to school, fearing it might hurt their marriage prospects. However, since Bholi, with her
                    pockmarked face and perceived dullness, was not expected to be married off, her parents decided to
                    send her to school to satisfy the Tehsildar.</div>

                <div class="page">Page 55</div>

                <p class="que">1. Does Bholi enjoy her first day at school?</p>
                <div class="ans">Initially, Bholi was frightened and wept when asked her name. She sat in a corner, but
                    the attractive pictures on the classroom walls and the gentle, kind behavior of her teacher made her
                    feel comfortable. By the end of the day, she was looking forward to her new life and thus ended up
                    liking the school.</div>

                <p class="que">2. Does she find her teacher to be different from the people at home?</p>
                <div class="ans">Yes, Bholi found her teacher to be different from those at home. At home, she was
                    neglected, criticized, and made fun of. In contrast, her teacher treated her with kindness and
                    encouragement, which deeply touched Bholi’s heart.</div>

                <div class="page">Page 58</div>

                <p class="que">1. Why do Bholi’s parents accept Bishamber’s marriage proposal?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bholi’s parents accepted Bishamber’s proposal because he was a wealthy grocer who did
                    not demand any dowry.</div>

                <p class="que">2. Why does the marriage not take place?</p>
                <div class="ans">The marriage did not take place because Bishamber, seeing Bholi’s pockmarked face,
                    demanded a dowry of five thousand rupees. When Ramlal had no choice but to agree, Bholi refused to
                    marry the greedy man, asserting her dignity and rights. Consequently, the marriage party was sent
                    away.</div>

                <div class="page">Page 62</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It</p>

                <p class="que">1. Bholi had many apprehensions about going to school. What made her feel that she was
                    going to a better place than her home?</p>
                <div class="ans">On the day she was going to school, Bholi received special attention: she was bathed
                    and her hair was done nicely. This treatment was a stark contrast to her usual neglect at home,
                    making her feel she was going to a better place.</div>

                <p class="que">2. How did Bholi’s teacher play an important role in changing the course of her life?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bholi’s teacher helped her overcome her initial fears and stammering by treating her
                    with kindness and encouraging her to be confident. The teacher taught her to read and write, making
                    her aware of her rights and transforming her into an independent, self-assured individual.</div>

                <p class="que">3. Why did Bholi at first agree to an unequal match? Why did she later reject the
                    marriage? What does this tell about her?</p>
                <div class="ans">Bholi initially agreed to the marriage to meet her parents’ wishes. She later rejected
                    the match when Bishamber demanded a dowry, demonstrating her awareness of her rights and her refusal
                    to accept an unjust situation. This shows Bholi’s growth from a timid girl to a confident woman who
                    values her dignity and self-respect.</div>

                <p class="que">4. Bholi’s real name is Sulekha. We are told this right at the beginning. But only in the
                    last but one paragraph of the story is Bholi called Sulekha again. Why do you think she is called
                    Sulekha at that point in the story?</p>
                <div class="ans">The name Bholi, meaning ‘simpleton,’ reflects her initial state of naivety. By the end
                    of the story, when she is called Sulekha, it signifies her transformation into a literate,
                    intelligent, and self-assured individual. The use of her real name represents her growth and
                    assertion of her self-worth.</div>

                <p class="que">5. Bholi’s teacher helped her overcome social barriers by encouraging and motivating her.
                    How do you think you can contribute towards changing the social attitudes illustrated in this story?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">To change social attitudes, we can reject dowry practices and promote gender equality.
                    We should ensure equal rights and opportunities for both boys and girls, respect individuals
                    regardless of their abilities or appearances, and challenge discriminatory practices.</div>

                <p class="que">6. Should girls be aware of their rights and assert them? Should girls and boys have the
                    same rights, duties, and privileges? What are some of the ways in which society treats them
                    differently? When we speak of ‘Human rights,’ do we differentiate between girls’ rights and boys’
                    rights?</p>
                <div class="ans">Yes, girls should be aware of their rights and assert them. Boys and girls should have
                    equal rights, duties, and privileges. Society often treats them differently by allocating more
                    resources to boys’ education and career opportunities, while girls may be prepared primarily for
                    domestic roles. Although human rights are universal, societal norms frequently lead to different
                    treatment based on gender.</div>

                <p class="que">7. Do you think the characters in the story were speaking to each other in English? If
                    not, in which language were they speaking? (You can get clues from the names of the persons and the
                    non-English words used in the story.)</p>
                <div class="ans">No, the characters were likely speaking in Hindi. Words such as ‘nambardar,’ ‘tehsildar
                    sahib,’ ‘izzat,’ and ‘pitaji,’ as well as names like ‘Ramlal’ and ‘Bholi,’ suggest that Hindi was
                    the language used.</div>

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image

                <div class="ans">There were books for everything, from anteaters to Zulus. Books taught people what to
                    do, how to do, when to do, and why to do. They explained, educated, directed, and decorated. No

                    cannot be totally replaced. Books can never go out of life although they may exist in a different

                <p class="que">4. Why are books referred to as a man’s best companion? Which is your favourite book and
                    why? Write a paragraph about that book.</p>
                <div class="ans">A book is a man’s best companion because it is always there. It never leaves us alone.
                    It is there with us even when everyone else is gone. Books guide us, instruct us, make us laugh,
                    inform us, inspire us, and are always true to us. My favourite book is *Peter Pan*. It is a fairy
                    tale. I love the character of Peter. He lives in fantasies. He is a child who never wants to grow
                    up, and he never does. He enjoys thrills and adventures and even takes the kids from Earth on a
                    merry adventure. The book inspires as it shows that one can remain a child at heart forever. The
                    sense of wonder, innocence, purity, joy, and the capacity to dream can stay in the human heart
                    forever.</div>

                <p class="que">Think About It</p>

                <p class="que">1. In what ways does Think-Tank misinterpret innocent nursery rhymes as threats to the
                    Martians? Can you think of any incidents where you misinterpreted a word or an action? How did you
                    resolve the misunderstanding?</p>
                <div class="ans">The words like ‘shell’ and ‘silver’ make Think-Tank think that humans grew them on
                    farms. Also, there is a line about ‘cow’ and ‘moon’. Additionally, the picture of Humpty Dumpty and
                    the rhyme of ‘great fall’ make Think-Tank think that humans were about to invade Mars. I had a
                    similar misunderstanding with a friend. However, I was fortunate as I discovered the actual truth
                    just in time. I did not believe what I had heard earlier.</div>

                <p class="que">2. The aliens in the play speak English. Do you think this is their language? What could
                    be the language of the aliens?</p>
                <div class="ans">No, English was not their language. If it had been so, they would not have
                    misinterpreted the nursery rhymes. They could be speaking some Martian language.</div>

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.

                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="page">Page 14</div>

                <p class="que">1. What is a “dust of snow”? What does the poet say has changed his mood? How has the
                    poet’s mood changed?</p>
                <div class="ans">The ‘dust of snow’ means the fine particles or flakes of snow. The sudden shower in the
                    form of the dust of snow changed the poet’s mood. The poet’s mood changed from sad to happy. He felt
                    refreshed and wanted to enjoy the rest of the day.</div>

                <p class="que">2. How does Frost present nature in this poem? The following questions may help you to
                    think of an answer:</p>
                <p class="que">- What are the birds that are usually named in poems? Do you think crow is often
                    mentioned in poems? What images come to your mind when you think of a crow?</p>
                <p class="que">- Again, what is ‘a hemlock tree’? Why doesn’t the poet write about more ‘beautiful’
                    trees such as a maple, or an oak, or a pine?</p>
                <p class="que">- What do the ‘crow’ and ‘hemlock’ represent—joy or sorrow? What does the dust of snow
                    that the crow shakes off a hemlock tree stand for?</p>

                <div class="ans">Frost presents nature in a very different manner in the poem.

                    Generally, poets use birds and trees known for their beauty and good qualities, like peacocks,
                    parrots, cuckoos, mynahs, and trees full of beautiful flowers and fruits. However, Frost takes a
                    unique approach by choosing a crow, which is not often mentioned in poems. Crows are black and
                    harsh-sounding, often associated with bad omens, creating a depressing and sorrowful image.

                    A hemlock tree is a poisonous plant with small white flowers. Frost chose not to use more beautiful
                    trees like oak, maple, or pine to reflect his mood and feelings accurately. The crow and hemlock
                    tree symbolize the sorrow and depression experienced by the poet. The dust of snow represents a
                    natural joy and energy. The snow that the crow shakes off the hemlock tree signifies a transition
                    from sadness and depression to a state of joy and optimism.</div>

                <p class="que">3. Have there been times when you felt depressed or hopeless? Have you experienced a
                    similar moment that changed your mood that day?</p>
                <div class="ans">There have been innumerable times when I too have felt depressed and hopeless.
                    Sometimes, such moments were aroused by other people’s behavior and attitude, and sometimes due to
                    my own conduct. On one occasion when I was very upset, I went out for a walk. While walking in the
                    park, I saw a girl playing with a puppy, embracing and feeding him. This little joy that they shared
                    changed my mood, and I felt very happy for the rest of the day. I also joined them and played with
                    the puppy.</div>

                    world will end some day as anything that has a beginning will have an end. This stands true for the
                    world also. If the Sun got so hot that it burst, the whole of the Earth would perish immediately as
                    no part of the Earth can bear the heat of that intensity. But if the Sun grew colder and colder,

                <div class="ans">The rhyme scheme of the poem is a b a a b c b c b. This rhyme scheme helps in bringing
                    out the contrasting ideas of ‘fire’ and ‘ice’ presented in the poem. The poet mentions that both
                    fire and ice are probable ends of this world. He talks about how fire represents desire and can
                    therefore be a cause of the end of the world. Frost also mentions ice to symbolize that the coldness
                    and indifference towards one another will be enough to end the world. In the second stanza, he says
                    that he knows of enough hate in the world to be sure that even destruction through ice would be
                    sufficient to bring about the end of the world.</div>

                <p class="que">1. Notice the use of a word repeated in lines such as these:</p>
                <p class="que">- On pads of velvet quiet, In his quiet rage.</p>
                <p class="que">- And stares with his brilliant eyes At the brilliant stars.</p>
                <p class="que">What do you think is the effect of this repetition?</p>
                <div class="ans">This repetition is a poetic device used by the poet to increase the intensity of the
                    tiger’s rage and his helpless silence. ‘Velvet quiet’ refers to the quiet velvet pads of the tiger,
                    which cannot run or leap. They can only walk around the limited space in the cage. The use of ‘quiet
                    rage’ symbolizes the anger and ferocity building up inside the tiger as it wants to run out into the
                    forest and attack a deer, but the rage is quiet because he is locked in the cage and is helpless.
                    The repetition of ‘quiet’ thus brings immense beauty to the poem. Similarly, the use of ‘brilliant’
                    for the tiger’s eyes and the stars also highlights their magnificence. The tiger stares at the
                    brilliant stars with his brilliant eyes, dreaming about how beautiful his life could be in the
                    forest. The repetition gives a wonderful effect to the poem.</div>

                <div class="ans">Several species of animals are on the verge of extinction. Even tigers and lions are
                    not safe in the forest due to poaching and trade. Zoos are thus necessary for the protection and
                    conservation of these species. Zoos provide safety and can also be used to educate the public about
                    the importance of wild animals and their role in maintaining ecological balance. Wildlife
                    sanctuaries, reserves, and national parks are alternatives to zoos. These not only help in the
                    protection and conservation of these species but also provide them with a natural habitat.</div>

                <p class="que">Thinking about the Poem (Page 45)</p>

<p class="que">1. Does ‘Dyin’ really rhyme with ‘lion’? Can you say it in such a way that it does?</p>
<div class="ans">No, ‘Dyin’ does not rhyme with ‘lion’. If we change the pronunciation of ‘lion’ by speaking it as ‘lying’, then it may rhyme with the word ‘dyin’.</div>

<p class="que">2. How does the poet suggest that you identify the lion and the tiger? When can you do so according to him?</p>
<div class="ans">A lion is a large and tawny beast. A Bengal Tiger has black stripes on its yellow coat. A lion roars when it falls upon its prey, while a tiger attacks silently. We can identify the two while roaming in the jungle.</div>

<p class="que">3. Do you think the words ‘lept’ and ‘lep’ in the third stanza are spelt correctly? Why does the poet spell them like this?</p>
<div class="ans">The words ‘lept’ and ‘lep’ are not spelt correctly. The poet has spelt them like this in order to maintain the rhythm of the poem. The correct spelling of the word ‘lept’ is ‘leapt’ and ‘lep’ is ‘leap’. The poet has intentionally spelt them incorrectly to create a sense of humour.</div>

<p class="que">4. Do you know what a ‘bearhug’ is? It’s a friendly and strong hug—such as bears are thought to give, as they attack you! Again, hyenas are thought to laugh and crocodiles to weep (‘crocodile tears’) as they swallow their victims. Are there similar expressions and popular ideas about wild animals in your own language(s)?</p>
<div class="ans">A bearhug is when the bear hugs its prey tightly with both hands and presses it to death. There are indeed similar expressions and popular ideas about wild animals in every language. For example, in Hindi, we say ‘Magarmach ke aansu aaana’ (Crocodile tears), ‘Haathi ke daant dikhane ke aur, khane ke aur’, ‘Ab pachtaye hot kya jab chidiya chug gai khet’, and ‘Girgit ke tarah rang badalna’.</div>

<p class="que">5. Look at the line ‘A novice might nonplus.’ How would you write this ‘correctly’? Why is the poet’s ‘incorrect’ line better in the poem?</p>
<div class="ans">The line “A novice might nonplus” can be written correctly as “A novice might be nonplussed”. However, the poet’s incorrect line is better in the poem as it maintains the rhyme scheme. By writing it incorrectly, ‘nonplus’ rhymes with ‘thus’.</div>

<p class="que">6. Can you find other examples of poets taking liberties with language, either in English or in your own language? Can you find examples of humorous poems in your own language(s)?</p>
<div class="ans">One can find plenty of examples in poetry where poets take liberties with language, known as ‘poetic licence’. For instance, the word ‘prest’ is used instead of ‘pressed’ in the line: “A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earth’s sweat flowing breast.” In Hindi, humorous poems and playful use of language can be found in works by poets like Kavi Kumar Vishwas and Harivansh Rai Bachchan.</div>

<p class="que">7. Much of the humour in the poem arises from the way language is used. Although the ideas are funny as well. If there are particular lines in the poem that you especially like, share these lines with the class, speaking briefly about what it is about the ideas or the language that you like or find funny.</p>
<div class="ans">The way the poet uses language and ideas in the poem is indeed humorous. The lines “A noble wild beast greets you” and “He’ll only lep and lep again” stand out. The idea of a wild beast greeting you is quite funny, and the language in “lep” from the word ‘leopard’ adds to the humour. The playful manipulation of words and concepts brings a lighthearted touch to the poem.</div>

                <span>[ NCERT Solutions of CHAPTER 5: -- " The Ball Poem " ]</span>
                <p class="que">1. Why does the poet say, “I would not intrude on him”? Why doesn’t he offer him money to buy another ball?</p>
<div class="ans">The poet says, “I would not intrude on him” because he does not want to intervene in the natural process of learning. He wants the boy to learn the meaning of loss on his own. He also doesn’t offer him money to buy another ball because that would be worthless. He wants the boy to learn the lesson of responsibility.</div>

<p class="que">2. “ …. staring down All his young days into the harbour where His ball went…. ” Do you think the boy has had the ball for a long time? Is it linked to the memories of days when he played with it?</p>
<div class="ans">Yes, the boy has had the ball for a long time. When it bounced into the water, all his memories of the days of childhood flashed in front of him. This led to a realisation that those moments would not come back, just like the ball. He can buy new balls and create new moments, but those that are gone would not return.</div>

<p class="que">3. What does “in the world of possessions” mean?</p>
<div class="ans">“In the world of possessions” means that the world is full of materialistic things. Here everything and every action is made to possess something, whether it is the possession of land, property, money, or any other thing. The poet suggests that losing a ball, which is a very small thing, would make the boy understand what it is like to lose something that one possessed.</div>

<p class="que">4. Do you think the boy has lost anything earlier? Pick out the words that suggest the answer.</p>
<div class="ans">No, it seems that the boy had not lost anything earlier. The words that suggest so are “He senses first responsibility in a world of possessions”.</div>

<p class="que">5. What does the poet say the boy is learning from the loss of the ball? Try to explain this in your own words.</p>
<div class="ans">The poet says that the boy is learning to cope with the loss of the ball. He is experiencing grief and learning to grow up in this world of possessions. He learns that there are so many things in life that are lost and cannot be brought back. He is sensing his first responsibility as he has lost the ball. The boy will learn how to stand up and leave the losses behind as he would have understood the true meaning and nature of loss.</div>

                <span>[ NCERT Solutions of CHAPTER 6: -- " Amanda " ]</span>
                <p class="que">1. How old do you think Amanda is? How do you know this?</p>
<div class="ans">Amanda is about a 9-10 year old school-going girl. She is being scolded for things typical for that particular age. Her parents are trying to inculcate in her good manners and etiquette. Amanda is very innocent and immature.</div>

<p class="que">2. Who do you think is speaking to her?</p>
<div class="ans">One of her parents is speaking to her. Most probably it is her mother. In a traditional household, the mother is often held responsible for the conduct of the child. In this case also, the range of instructions suggests that the speaker is Amanda’s mother.</div>

<p class="que">3. Why are stanzas 2, 4, and 6 given in parenthesis?</p>
<div class="ans">Stanzas 2, 4, and 6 are given in parenthesis because they reflect the inner thoughts of Amanda. They can be taken as the reaction of the child to the instructions given in stanzas 1, 3, and 5. This format creates an alternating sequence of scolding from the mother and Amanda's imaginative escape from it. The use of parenthesis helps in making the reading of the poem more engaging.</div>

<p class="que">4. Who is the speaker in stanzas 2, 4, and 6? Do you think this speaker is listening to the speaker in stanzas 1, 3, 5, and 7?</p>
<div class="ans">The speaker in stanzas 2, 4, and 6 is Amanda herself. She is not paying any attention to the speaker of stanzas 1, 3, and 5, as she is lost in her own world of imagination. Her thoughts provide her an escape from the reality of her parents' nagging.</div>

<p class="que">5. What could Amanda do if she were a mermaid?</p>
<div class="ans">Amanda wishes to be a mermaid so she could move carelessly along on a languid emerald sea. She longs for a place where she can be alone and at peace, without the constraints and expectations of the human world. For Amanda, a mermaid symbolizes freedom and solitude.</div>

<p class="que">6. Is Amanda an orphan? Why does she say so?</p>
<div class="ans">No, Amanda is not an orphan, though she wishes to be one. She is overwhelmed by her parents' constant nagging and imagines that life would be better without them. Amanda’s longing for solitude and freedom makes her feel as though she would be happier if she were an orphan.</div>

<p class="que">7. Do you know the story of Rapunzel? Why does she want to be Rapunzel?</p>
<div class="ans">The story of Rapunzel revolves around a girl who is locked in a high tower by a witch. Rapunzel's long golden hair is used by the witch to visit her. Eventually, a prince rescues her, and despite some trials, they are united forever. Amanda wishes to be like Rapunzel because she seeks peace and isolation from the world. She desires a life of tranquility away from everyone and wishes to avoid being disturbed by others.</div>

<p class="que">8. What does the girl yearn for? What does this poem tell you about Amanda?</p>
<div class="ans">Amanda yearns for freedom, space, and a world where she is not burdened by the expectations of her parents. This poem reveals Amanda as a symbol for children who feel stifled by societal expectations. She represents the struggle of children who wish to preserve their imagination and individuality against the pressures of traditional expectations.</div>

<p class="que">9. Read the last stanza. Do you think Amanda is sulking and is moody?</p>
<div class="ans">No, Amanda is neither sulking nor moody. She is simply disinterested in the nagging of her parents and prefers to engage with her imaginative thoughts. Her lack of interest in the scolding reflects her desire to escape into a world of her own rather than reacting negatively.</div>

                <p class="que">1. Notice the use of the word ‘turn’ in the first line, “I think I could turn and live with animals…”. What is the poet turning from?</p>
<div class="ans">In this line, the poet is symbolically turning from human nature and its complexities to embrace the simplicity and purity of animal life. This turning signifies a detachment from human concerns and an appreciation for the straightforward existence of animals.</div>

<p class="que">2. Mention three things that humans do and animals don’t.</p>
<div class="ans">Animals do not cry or complain about their conditions. They do not commit sins and therefore do not weep for them. Additionally, animals are generally content and have no desire for material possessions, whereas humans often complain, commit sins, and are driven by a desire to own things.</div>

<p class="que">3. Do humans kneel to other humans who lived thousands of years ago? Discuss this in groups.</p>
<div class="ans">Yes, humans often show reverence or respect to historical figures from thousands of years ago through cultural practices, rituals, and traditions. This can include paying homage, honoring their contributions, or adhering to customs associated with their legacies. Students can discuss how this manifests in their own cultures and explore various rituals and traditions related to honoring historical figures.</div>

<p class="que">4. What are the ‘tokens’ that the poet says he may have dropped long ago, and which the animals have kept for him? Discuss this in class.</p>
<div class="ans">The ‘tokens’ in the poem symbolize the essential virtues of human nature that have been lost or forgotten over time. These include qualities such as simplicity, honesty, and contentment. The poet suggests that animals, by virtue of their natural existence, have preserved these fundamental aspects of our nature that humans often choose to ignore or deny. This reflects a critique of how civilization may have led humans away from their true, inherent nature.</div>

                <span>[ NCERT Solutions of CHAPTER 8: -- " The Trees " ]</span>
                <p class="que">1. Find, in the first stanza, three things that cannot happen in a treeless forest.</p>
<div class="ans">
    The three things that cannot happen in a treeless forest are:
    <br> - The sitting of a bird on trees.
    <br> - The hiding of insects.
    <br> - The sun burying its feet in the shadow of the forest.
</div>

<p class="que">2. What picture do these words create in your mind: “….. sun bury its feet in shadow…..”? What could the poet mean by the sun’s ‘feet’?</p>
<div class="ans">
    The sun’s ‘feet’ refers to the rays of the sun that fall on the earth. In a treeless forest, there are no shadows to hide the rays, so they fall directly on the ground. In a forest with trees, the shadows created by the trees obscure the sun’s rays, making it seem as though the sun is burying its feet in the shadow.
</div>

<p class="que">3. Where are the trees in the poem? What do their roots, their leaves, and their twigs do?</p>
<div class="ans">
    In the poem, the trees are trapped inside the poet’s house. Their roots work all night to disengage themselves from the cracks in the veranda floor. The leaves try hard to move towards the glass to break it, and the small twigs get stiff with exertion.
</div>

<p class="que">4. What does the poet compare their branches to?</p>
<div class="ans">
    The poet compares the branches of the trees to newly discharged patients of a hospital. The large branches become cramped under the roof and, when they finally get free, they rush out stumblingly to the outside world, looking half-shocked, similar to patients eagerly leaving the hospital.
</div>

<p class="que">5. How does the poet describe the moon:
    <br> (a) at the beginning of the third stanza, and
    <br> (b) at its end? What causes this change?
</p>
<div class="ans">
    (a) At the beginning of the third stanza, the poet describes the moon as shining brightly in the open sky on a fresh night.
    <br> (b) At the end of the stanza, the moon appears to break into pieces like a broken mirror and shines on the heads of the tallest oak trees. This change happens because as the trees move outside, they partially obscure the moonlight, making it seem as though the moon has shattered.
</div>

<p class="que">6. What happens to the house when the trees move out of it?</p>
<div class="ans">
    When the trees move out of the house, the glasses break, and the whispers of the trees vanish, leaving the house silent.
</div>

<p class="que">7. Why do you think the poet does not mention “the departure of the forest from the house” in her letters? (Could it be that we are often silent about important happenings that are so unexpected that they embarrass us? Think about this again when you answer the next set of questions.)</p>
<div class="ans">
    The poet may not mention “the departure of the forest from the house” in her letters because it is an event that is so significant and unexpected that it feels too overwhelming or embarrassing to describe. The poet might believe that others would not understand or care about the effort of the trees to regain their freedom, reflecting how profound or unexpected events are often left unspoken.
</div>

<p class="que">8. Now that you have read the poem in detail, we can begin to ask what the poem might mean. Here are two suggestions. Can you think of others?</p>
<div class="ans">
    1. Yes, the poem does present a conflict between man and nature. It highlights how human actions, such as keeping trees inside walls and cutting down forests, imprison nature and deny it its freedom. This mirrors the theme in "A Tiger in the Zoo," where animals feel confined by their cages and yearn to be free in their natural habitat.
    <br> 2. If trees are used as a metaphor for human beings, the poem reflects how people also feel trapped by the constraints of modern life. The desire of trees to break free parallels the human longing for liberation from societal boundaries and the struggle to reclaim one's true nature amidst the pressures of modern civilization.

<div class="ans">
    Sandburg thinks that the fog is like a cat.
</div>

<p class="que">2. How does the fog come?</p>
<div class="ans">
    The fog comes silently, moving in like a cat on its small feet.

<p class="que">3. What does ‘it’ in the third line refer to? CBSE 2012</p>

    ‘It’ refers to the fog.
</div>

<p class="que">4. Does the poet actually say that the fog is like a cat? Find three things that tell us that the fog is like a cat.</p>
<div class="ans">
    The poet does not literally say that the fog is like a cat, but uses the metaphor of a cat for comparison. 
    <br> Three things that suggest the fog is like a cat are:
    <br> - It comes silently like a cat on its small feet.
    <br> - It looks over like a cat.
    <br> - It sits on its haunches like a cat.
</div>

<p class="que">5. Does this poem have a rhyme scheme? Poetry that does not have an obvious rhythm or rhyme is called ‘free verse’.</p>
<div class="ans">
    This poem does not have a rhyme scheme as the lines do not end with similar sounds. There is no pattern of rhyme, so the poem is written in free verse.
