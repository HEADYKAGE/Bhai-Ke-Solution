            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
                postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.
                Compassionate and Kind: Moved by Lencho's faith, he rallies the office to help anonymously.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

                Compassionate: They contribute money, demonstrating their willingness to help those in need.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

                Represents Faith and Hope: While not a physical character, God embodies the concept of faith as a source
                of hope and the belief in a higher power's intervention.</pre>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch1">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch3">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch4">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.

                postmaster.</pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch8">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <p class="que"></p>
            <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
            <pre class="que"># The Postman:

        <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch9">
            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
            destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
            as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
            turned violent and destroyed everything.
            Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
            themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
            God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called

        <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
            life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
            nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
            descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
            unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
            those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
            directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
            hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

        <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
            unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
            farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

        <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
            amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
            recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

        <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
            decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
            Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

        <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
            is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
            confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

        <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
            money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
            the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
            highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
            a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
            sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
        <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
            described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
            of the devastation.</p>
        <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
            destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
            damage.</p>
        <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
            "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
        <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
            unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
        <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
            the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
            and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
        <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
            the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.

            Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
            problems. There are few sentences which show this

            But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
            single hope help from God.
            All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
            instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
            “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
            He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
            God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

            Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
            Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


            When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
            faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
            friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
        </div>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
            presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
            other than him who would send him the money.
            His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
            problem.

            (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
            amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
            hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
            mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
            The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
            to keep his faith alive in God.

            Ungrateful,
            Selfish,
            Comical,
            Unquestioning,
            It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
            He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
            address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
            lovable and different

        <p class="que">
            Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
            themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
            destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
            as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
            turned violent and destroyed everything.
            Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
            themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
            God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
            them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
            this conflict.

        <!-- <p class="que"> -->
        <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
            life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
            nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
            descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
            unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
            those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
            directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
            hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

        <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
            unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
            farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

        <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
            amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
            recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

        <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
            decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
            Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

        <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
            is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
            confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

        <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
            money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
            the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
            highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
            a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
            sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our

            But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
            single hope help from God.
            All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
            instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
            “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
            He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
            God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

        <div class="ans">
            Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
            Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


            When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
            faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
            friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.

        <p class="que">
            Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
            presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
            other than him who would send him the money.
            His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

            Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
            (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
            amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
            hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
            mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
            The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
            to keep his faith alive in God.

            It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
            He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
            address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally

        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
            destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
            as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
            turned violent and destroyed everything.
            Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
            themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
            God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
            them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
            this conflict.

        <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
            life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
            nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
            descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
            unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
            those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
            directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
            hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

        <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
            unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
            farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

        <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
            amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
            recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

        <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
            decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
            Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

        <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
            is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
            confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

        <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
            money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
            the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
            highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
            a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
            sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <span>[ Character Sketch of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
        <p class="que"></p>
        <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
        <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
        <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

    <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch4">
        <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
        <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
            described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
            of the devastation.</p>
        <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
            destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
            damage.</p>
        <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
            "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
        <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
            unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
        <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
            the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
            and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
        <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
            the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

        <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
            amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
            recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

        <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
            decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
            Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

        <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
            is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
            confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

        <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
            money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
            the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
            highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
            a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
            sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
            problems. There are few sentences which show this

            But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
            single hope help from God.
            All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
            instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
            “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
            He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
            God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
        </div>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
            Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


            When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
            faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
            friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
        </div>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
            presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
            other than him who would send him the money.
            His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
            problem.
        </div>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
            (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
            amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
            hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
            mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
            The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
            to keep his faith alive in God.
        </div>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You

        </p>
        <div class="ans">

            Ungrateful,
            Selfish,
            Comical,
            Unquestioning,
            It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
            He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
            address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
            lovable and different
        </div>

        <p class="que">
            Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
            themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
            destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
            as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
            turned violent and destroyed everything.
            Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
            themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
            God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
            them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
            this conflict.

        <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
            life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
            nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
            descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
            unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
            those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
            directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
            hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

        <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
            unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the

        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
            destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
            as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
            turned violent and destroyed everything.
            Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
            themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
            God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
            them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
            this conflict.

        <!-- <p class="que"> -->
        <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
            life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
            nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
            descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
            unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
            those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
            directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
            hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

        <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
            unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
            farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

        <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
            amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
            recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

        <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
            decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
            Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

        <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
            is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
            confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

        <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
            money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
            the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
            highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
            a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
            sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <span>[ Character Sketch of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
        <p class="que"></p>
        <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
        <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
        <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

            Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.

        <pre class="que"># The Other Post Office Employees:

            Compassionate: They contribute money, demonstrating their willingness to help those in need.</pre>
        <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

    <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch7">
        <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
        <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
            described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
            of the devastation.</p>
        <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
            destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
            damage.</p>
        <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
            "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
        <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
            unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
        <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
            the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
            and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
        <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
            the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

            He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
            address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally

            Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
            themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
            destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
            as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
            turned violent and destroyed everything.
            Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
            themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
            God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
            them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
            this conflict.

        <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
            life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
            nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
            descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

        <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
            unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
            those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
            directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
            hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

        <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
            unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
            farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

        <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
            amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
            recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

        <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
            decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
            Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

        <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
            is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
            confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

        <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
            money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
            the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

        <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
            highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
            a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
            sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

        <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is

        <p class="que">
            Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
            problems. There are few sentences which show this

            But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
            single hope help from God.
            All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
            instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
            “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
            He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
            God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

            Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


            When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
            faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
            friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
        </div>

        <p class="que">

        </p>
        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
            presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else

        <div class="ans">
            Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the

            unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
        <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
            the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
            and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
        <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
            the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>
