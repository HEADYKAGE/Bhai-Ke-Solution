            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 7,8)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Who does Lencho have complete faith in? Which sentences in the story tell you this?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in our
                problems. There are few sentences which show this

                But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                single hope help from God.
                All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had been
                instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Why does the postmaster send money to Lencho? Why does he sign the letter God?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees and
                friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Did Lencho try to find out who had sent the money to him? Why or why not?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                other than him who would send him the money.
                His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his
                problem.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Who does Lencho think has taken the rest of the money? What is the irony in the situation?
                (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is strange or
                amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had demanded a
                hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and tried
                to keep his faith alive in God.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Are there people like Lencho in the real world? What kind of a person would you say he is? You
                may select appropriate words from the box to answer the question.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Greedy,
                Naive,
                Stupid,
                Ungrateful,
                Selfish,
                Comical,
                Unquestioning,
                It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of person.
                He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is totally
                lovable and different
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by the
                destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good harvest
                as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                turned violent and destroyed everything.
                Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded from
                God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He called
                them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise to
                this conflict.

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer whose
                life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent hailstorm
                descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

            <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness. His
                unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely help
                those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by the
                hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

            <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by the
                farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

            <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although initially
                amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple faith. He
                recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

            <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

            <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God." Lencho
                is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

            <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from the
                money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding about
                the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

            <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also introduces
                a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid image
                of the devastation.</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the hailstorm's
                destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                damage.</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's life,
                the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's touch,
                and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
            <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The beauty of
                the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                ques.3. At the beginning of his speech, Mandela mentions “an extraordinary human disaster”. What does he
                mean by this? What is the “glorious human achievement” he speaks of at the end?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By ‘an extraordinary human disaster’ Mandela means to state the practice of apartheid in South
                Africa. During this there was a racial segregation based on colour and the blacks suffered a lot. They
                were not allowed to demand freedom or any right. Mandela himself did spend many years on infamous
                ‘Robben Island’ as a prisoner where he was beaten mercilessly. He considered it as great glorious human
                achievement that a black person became the President of a country where the blacks were not even
                considered human beings and were treated badly.

                because not too long ago, the South Africans were considered outlaws. He thus thanks all of them for
                having come to witness the historical ceremony. This was a gesture of international recognition to a

                human dignity.</div>

                loyalty which was of great significance as during apartheid era they would have arrested him. The change
                in their attitude was because of struggle and sacrifices put in by many heroes of South Africa. This

                mindsets of many. He believed that love can also be taught and human being is naturally inclined towards

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. (i) In the first decade of the century, the whites erected a system of racial domination against
                the blacks, thus creating the basis of one of the harshest and most inhumane societies the world had
                ever known.
                (ii) In the final decade of the 20th century, the . previous system had been overturned and replaced by
                one which recognised rights and freedom of all people regardless of color of their skin.

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. For Mandela courage does not mean the absence of fear but a victory over fear. According to him

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mandela mentions that every man has twin obligations. The first is to his family, parents, wife and
                children; the second obligation is to his people, his community and his country.

            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Like any other kid, for Mandela freedom meant to make merry and enjoy the blissful life. Once one
                becomes an adult, antics of childhood looks like transitory because most of the childish activities are
                wasteful from an adult’s perspective. Once you are adult, you have to earn a livelihood to bring the
                bacon home. Its only then when you get an honourable existence in the family and in the society.

                of hatred who is behind the bars of prejudice and narrow-mindedness. He realises that both the oppressor
                and the oppressed are robbed of their humanity and peace.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Why did such a large number of international leaders attend the inauguration ? What did it
                signify the triumph of?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. To be the part of the inauguration, international leaders showed a gesture of solidarity from
                international community to the idea of end of apartheid. It was the significance of the victory of good
                over evil and triumph of a tolerant society without any discrimination.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. What does Mandela mean when he says he is “simply the sum of all those African patriots”, who
                had gone before him ?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. By saying that he is simply the sum of all those African patriots, Mandela wants to pay his tribute
                to all the people who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of freedom. He says that he is grateful
                to those who had gone before him because those heroes of past had paved the path of co-operation and
                unity for him. Therefore, he could try to come to power to bring equality for his people with their
                support.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Would you agree that the “depths of oppression” create “heights of character”? How does Mandela
                illustrate this? Can you add your own examples to this argument ?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. I agree with the statement that depths of oppression create heights of character. Nelson Mandela
                illustrates this by giving examples of great heroes of South Africa like Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu and
                others who were inspired to sacrifice their lives in the long freedom struggle.
                India is full of such examples, during our freedom struggle there was a galaxy of leaders of great
                characters and the oppression of British rule created and encouraged people of noble characters like
                Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai, JL Nehru, Chandra Shekhar Ajad, Sardar Bhagat Singh and many more. If
                we compare them with the quality of political leaders India is having today, then Nelson Mandela seems
                to be absolutely right.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. How did Mandela’s understanding of freedom change with age and experience?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. With age and experience, Mandela understood the real meaning of freedom. As a young boy, he thought
                that he was born free and believed that as long as he obeyed his father and abided by the customs of his
                tribe, he was free in every possible manner. As he grew older, freedom to raise a family and freedom to
                earn livelihood started dominating his thoughts. Gradually he realised that he was selfish during his
                boyhood. He slowly understood that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the freedom
                of all blacks. It was the freedom from fear and prejudice. Age and experience widened his perspective of
                freedom.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. How did Mandela’s ‘hunger for freedom’ change his life?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mandela realised in his youth that it was not just his freedom that was being curtailed, but the
                freedom of all blacks. This changed the fearfulman to a fearless rebel.
                He sacrificed the comforts of a settled family life to fight for a greater cause. He joined the African
                National Congress and this changed him from a frightened young man into a bold one who fought against
                racial prejudice.

            <span>[Summary of CHAPTER : 2 - " Nelson Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom " ] </span>
            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">["__The Spark That Ignited a Long Walk: A Summary of Nelson Mandela's Fight for Freedom__"]
            </p>
            <p class="que">The excerpt from Nelson Mandela's autobiography, "Long Walk to Freedom," likely focuses on
                his early life and the awakening of his fight against apartheid in South Africa. While it might not be a
                full chapter, it offers a glimpse into the seeds of a lifelong struggle. Here's a detailed breakdown:
            </p>

            <p class="que"># From Tribal Freedom to a Universal Yearning:</p>

            <p class="que">The young Nelson Mandela cherished the freedom he experienced within the structure of his
                Xhosa tribe. He likely enjoyed a sense of belonging and a degree of personal liberty.</p>
            <p class="que">However, this understanding of freedom underwent a crucial transformation. Witnessing the
                harsh realities of racial discrimination against Black South Africans exposed him to a deeper meaning of
                freedom – one that encompassed collective liberation.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Birth of a Crusader:</p>

            <p class="que">This awakening sparked a yearning for a more just society, a society where freedom wasn't
                restricted by the color of one's skin. This desire for collective liberation became the driving force
                behind his actions.</p>
            <p class="que">The comfortable life he might have led within the tribal structure was no longer enough. He
                yearned to be part of something bigger, something that challenged the status quo.</p>
            <p class="que"># Joining the Fight: The Price of Freedom</p>

            <p class="que">The text likely mentions Mandela's involvement with the African National Congress (ANC), a
                key organization fighting against the oppressive apartheid regime. This was a defining moment, a
                commitment to a cause far greater than himself.</p>
            <p class="que">The excerpt might not delve into the details of the sacrifices he made, but it subtly hints
                at the challenges he embraced. Joining the ANC probably meant giving up a life of relative ease and
                security. It meant facing the wrath of a powerful regime and putting his own freedom at risk.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Long Walk Begins: Setting the Stage for the Future</p>

            <p class="que">The chapter doesn't explicitly mention Mandela's imprisonment on Robben Island or his
                eventual rise to presidency. However, it provides a crucial foundation for understanding his unwavering
                commitment to freedom and justice.</p>
            <p class="que">This glimpse into his early life sets the stage for exploring the long and arduous journey he
                undertook. It allows us to appreciate the unwavering spirit that propelled him to fight for a cause
                bigger than himself.</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes and Significance:</p>

            <p class="que">The excerpt beautifully portrays the evolution of Mandela's understanding of freedom. It
                transforms from a personal desire to a collective yearning for racial equality.</p>
            <p class="que">It highlights the courage it takes to stand up against injustice, even when it means
                sacrificing personal comfort and safety.</p>
            <p class="que">This is just the beginning of Mandela's incredible story. The excerpt serves as a springboard
                to delve deeper into his struggles, the fight against apartheid, and the eventual triumph of democracy
                in South Africa.</p>
            <p class="que">This summary goes beyond a simple listing of events and delves into the deeper meaning behind
                Mandela's actions. It highlights the themes of sacrifice, courage, and the evolution of a freedom
                fighter. By understanding his early motivations, we gain a deeper appreciation for his lifelong
                dedication to dismantling apartheid and building a more just South Africa.</p>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are afraid to make their
                first flight, or are some birds more timid than others? Do you think a human baby also finds it a
                challenge to take its first step?
            </p>
            <p class="ans">
                Ans. The young seagull was afraid to fly because it was his first flight and he feared of falling and
                hurting himself. He thought that his wings would not support him while flying. Yes, it is natural that
                doing something for the first time is a bit challenging and fearful. All birds must be afraid to make
                their first flight.
                Similarly, a human baby is also afraid of taking the first step and find it challenging when he learns
                to crawl or stand up without support.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. “The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What compelled the young seagull
                to finally fly?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The young seagull was very hungry. It was this hunger that ultimately compelled it to fly. Its
                hunger intensified when it saw its mother tearing at a piece of fish that lay at her feet. It cried to
                her, begging her to get some food. When its mother came towards it with food in her beak, it screamed
                with joy and anticipation. However, she stopped midway. It wondered why she did not come nearer. Not
                being able to resist or controfits hunger any longer, it dived at the food in its mother’s beak. At that
                moment, his hunger overpowered his fear of the great expanse of sea beneath the cliff. Finally, this
                plunge was followed by the natural reaction of its body, i.e. to fly.

            <p class="que">
                ques.3. They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father and mother threaten
                him and cajole him to fly?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Seagull’s parents had tried everything but he was reluctant to fly due to fear of falling down. He
                looked at his brothers and sister but wouldn’t make any efforts. Thats why the whole family had left him
                alone and threatened and cojoled him to come but every effort went in vain.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. Have you ever had a similar experience, where your parents encouraged you to do something that
                you were too scared to try? Discuss this in pairs or groups.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. (Suggested Answer) Yes, I had a similar experience while leaning to ride a bicycle in class VI. In
                my initial attempts, I fell down everytime and developed a fear of cycling which was difficult to
                overcome.
                No amount of provoking and cajoling could let me try it again, but my father encouraged me to overcome
                the fear and helped me as he was adamant on my learning cycling. He took me on a mound near village and
                made me sit and asked me to put my hands on the handle and feet on the paddle. It sped down and I
                enjoyed it without fear which developed my confidence.


                Thus, I overcame my fear of cycling and started riding a cycle after a few practice.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. In the case of a bird flying, it seems a natural act, and a foregone conclusion that it should
                succeed. In the examples you have given in Answer to the previous question, was your success guaranteed,
                or was it important for you to try, regardless of a possibility of failure?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans.We face some problems in the initial stage while learning new skill. Due to the fear of failure, we
                hesitate to perform a task or to do something new. In case of the seagull his parents cajoled him to
                fly. In the example I have given in the answer of previous question, I was cajoled by my father to learn
                cycling. So, at that stage, I was to learn cycling as it was very important for me to overcome my fear.
                Yes, my success was guaranteed because if someone is determined to do something then success is assured.
                Moreover as said, practice, makes a man perfect.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. “I’ll take the risk”. What is the risk? Why does the narrator take it?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. A huge storm was brewing up and the author was
                keen to reach his home to spend his holiday with his family. So, he decided to fly through the storm as
                he did not want to miss the chance to meet his family at breakfast. Thus he took the risk even when the
                visibility was almost zero in the storm.
            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. Describe the narrator’s experience as he flew the aeroplane into the storm.
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. As the pilot (author) entered the storm, his plane started jumping and twisting. He could not see
                anything outside the plane as it was black. When he looked at compass and other instruments they had
                stopped to function due to storm. It was a terrible and fearsome experience for him. The fuel tank was
                almost empty and he could not fly more than ten minutes. Then he saw another black aeroplane by his side
                and the pilot of the plane signalled him to follow. It was a surprise for the narrator as the other
                black plane was having no light. He followed him without any choice and landed safely on the runway.

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Why does the narrator say, “I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the old Dakota…”?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Seagull’s parents had tried everything but he was reluctant to fly due to fear of falling down. He
                looked at his brothers and sister but wouldn’t make any efforts. Thats why the whole family had left him
                alone and threatened and cojoled him to come but every effort went in vain.

                Ques.4. What made the woman in the Control Centre look at the narrator strangely?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. The woman in the Control Centre looked at the
                narrator strangely because the narrator asked him about the black aeroplane and she saw no one except
                the narrator’s in the sky during the storm. Even the radar showed only the narrator’s plane that night
                in the sky.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. Who do you think helped the narrator to reach safely? Discuss this among yourselves and give
                reasons for your answer.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. It is very difficult to say about the unknown pilot who helped the narrator. But probably it was
                the narrator himself that helped him to overcome the fear in the storm as no other plane was seen in the
                radar except the narrator’s Dakota plane. In that fearsome situation, he might have been hallucinating.
                He himself was a good pilot and brave enough who helped himself land safely.

            <p class="que"># The Hesitant Flyer: A Summary of "His First Flight"</p>
            <p class="que">The first story in "Two Stories About Flying," titled "His First Flight" by Liam O'Flaherty,
                tells the tale of a young seagull who overcomes his fear to take his first flight. Here's a detailed
                breakdown of the story's key elements:</p>

            <p class="que"># The Weight of Fear:</p>

            <p class="que">The protagonist is a young seagull, on the cusp of fledging. Unlike his younger siblings who
                readily embrace the skies, he's crippled by fear.</p>
            <p class="que">The vastness of the open air and the thought of leaving the safety of the ledge terrify him.
                This fear is a powerful force that holds him back from experiencing the freedom of flight.</p>
            <p class="que"># Parental Pressure and Hunger Pangs:</p>

            <p class="que">The young seagull's parents try to motivate him to fly. They encourage him, scold him, and
                even threaten to leave him hungry if he doesn't take the leap.</p>
            <p class="que">Hunger becomes an additional pressure, forcing him to confront his fear in order to reach the
                food his parents offer.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unplanned Leap:</p>

            <p class="que">In a moment of desperation, driven by hunger and unable to resist the lure of the fish
                offered by his mother, the young seagull lunges forward and tumbles off the ledge.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unexpected Embrace of Flight:</p>

            <p class="que">In a surprising turn of events, the young seagull doesn't plummet to his death. Instead, he
                discovers to his astonishment that his wings hold him aloft.</p>
            <p class="que">The fear that had paralyzed him melts away, replaced by the exhilaration of flying. He soars
                through the air, experiencing the freedom he was previously too afraid to grasp.</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes Explored:</p>

            <p class="que">Overcoming Fear: The story is a classic tale of conquering one's fears. The young seagull
                represents anyone who struggles to take a leap of faith and step outside their comfort zone.</p>
            <p class="que">Parental Guidance: The parents' tough love approach, though seemingly harsh, ultimately
                pushes the young seagull to overcome his fear and achieve his potential.</p>
            <p class="que">The Power of Instinct: Despite his initial fear, the young seagull possesses an innate
                ability to fly. Once airborne, his instincts take over, allowing him to experience the joy of flight.
            </p>
            <p class="que"># Symbolism:</p>

            <p class="que">The vast sky represents freedom and possibility. It's a place the young seagull fears but
                ultimately learns to embrace.</p>
            <p class="que">The ledge symbolizes the young seagull's comfort zone, a place of safety but also limitation.
                By leaving the ledge, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
            <p class="que">Overall, "His First Flight" is a heartwarming story that celebrates the triumph of courage
                over fear. It reminds us that sometimes, the greatest discoveries lie just beyond our comfort zones.</p>

            <p class="que">The second story in "Two Stories About Flying," "The Black Aeroplane," by Frederick Forsyth,
                is a suspenseful tale filled with mystery and a touch of the supernatural. Here's a detailed breakdown
                of the story's key elements:</p>

            <p class="que"># The Setting:</p>

            <p class="que">The story takes place during a nighttime flight from Paris to London. The protagonist, a
                pilot (whose name is never revealed), is looking forward to a reunion with his family and a delicious
                breakfast upon landing.</p>
            <p class="que">#The Storm:</p>

            <p class="que">As the pilot flies over Paris, he encounters a massive storm with dark, threatening clouds.
                He has a decision to make: turn back to safety in Paris or continue towards London.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Risky Choice:</p>

            <p class="que">Driven by the desire to reunite with his family, the pilot makes a risky decision to fly
                through the storm. This choice sets the stage for the mysterious events that follow.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Black Aeroplane:</p>

            <p class="que">As visibility plummets due to the storm, the pilot's instruments malfunction - the compass
                goes dead, the radio cuts out, and the fuel gauge becomes unreliable. Suddenly, he spots another
                airplane, completely black and without any lights, flying ahead.</p>
            <p class="que"># Following the Unknown:</p>

            <p class="que">With no other options and a dwindling fuel supply, the pilot makes a desperate decision. He
                decides to follow the black aeroplane, hoping it will lead him to safety. This act of trust in a
                mysterious unknown entity adds to the suspense.</p>
            <p class="que"># A Glimmer of Hope:</p>

            <p class="que">After what feels like an eternity, the black aeroplane leads the pilot to a row of lights on
                the ground, a runway! He manages to land the plane safely, completely disoriented and bewildered by the
                experience.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Disappearance:</p>

            <p class="que">The pilot rushes to the airport terminal, desperate to find out more about the black
                aeroplane that guided him. However, to his utter astonishment, no one at the airport has any knowledge
                of another plane landing that night. The black aeroplane seems to have vanished without a trace.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Unexplained:</p>

            <p class="que">The story ends with the pilot left pondering the inexplicable events of the flight. Was the
                black aeroplane a figment of his imagination, a hallucination brought on by the stress of the storm? Or
                was it something more – a ghostly guide or a supernatural phenomenon?</p>
            <p class="que"># Themes:</p>

            <p class="que">The story explores themes of trust, fate, and the power of the unknown. It forces the reader
                to question the nature of reality and the possibility of encountering the inexplicable.</p>
            <p class="que">The pilot's risky decision to fly through the storm and his subsequent dependence on the
                black aeroplane highlight the dangers of prioritizing personal desires over safety.</p>
            <p class="que"># Open Ending:</p>

            <p class="que">The story's strength lies in its open ending. It leaves the reader free to draw their own
                conclusions about the black aeroplane and the pilot's experience. This ambiguity adds to the story's
                lasting impact.</p>
            <p class="que">Overall, "The Black Aeroplane" is a thrilling and thought-provoking story that leaves a
                lasting impression on the reader by weaving together themes of suspense, mystery, and the unknown.</p>

            <p class="que"> The Young Seagull: This unnamed seagull is the protagonist of the story. As detailed
                previously, he undergoes a significant transformation from a fearful and dependent chick to a courageous
                and independent flyer.</p>
            <p class="que"> While there aren't other fully developed characters, there are some additional elements to
                consider:</p>

            <p class="que"> The Parents: The young seagull's parents act as mentors and guides. They encourage him to
                fly, but ultimately force him to take the leap himself through tough love.</p>
            <p class="que"> The Siblings: The young seagull's siblings who have already learned to fly serve as both
                inspiration and a source of envy for the protagonist. They represent the freedom and independence he
                desires.</p>

            <p class="que"># The Pilot:</p>

            <p class="que">Personality: The pilot is never given a name, making him a more universal character. He seems
                to be a dedicated family man, eager to reunite with his loved ones and enjoy a good breakfast upon
                landing.</p>
            <p class="que">Motivation: He prioritizes reuniting with his family over safety, which leads him to make the
                risky decision to fly through the storm. This decision sets the stage for the encounter with the black
                aeroplane.</p>
            <p class="que">Development: Throughout the story, the pilot experiences a range of emotions. Initially
                confident, he becomes increasingly disoriented and frightened as the storm intensifies. He then exhibits
                desperation as he follows the black aeroplane and finally relief upon landing safely.</p>
            <p class="que">Significance: The pilot acts as the viewpoint character, drawing the reader into the
                suspenseful experience of the flight. His confusion and lack of answers regarding the black aeroplane
                mirror the reader's own uncertainty.</p>
            <p class="que"># The Black Aeroplane:</p>

            <p class="que">Description: The black aeroplane is shrouded in mystery. It's completely black, has no
                lights, and seems to appear and disappear without a trace.</p>
            <p class="que">Function: The black aeroplane acts as a mysterious guide, leading the pilot through the storm
                and to safety. However, its motives and origins remain unknown.</p>
            <p class="que">Impact: The black aeroplane adds a layer of suspense and the supernatural to the story. Its
                unexplained presence leaves the reader questioning its reality and purpose.</p>
            <p class="que">While there are no other fully developed characters, the story also mentions:</p>

            <p class="que">The Pilot's Family: Though unseen, they represent the pilot's motivation for taking risks and
                his desire for safety.</p>
            The Airport Staff: Their lack of knowledge about the black aeroplane further deepens the mystery.

            <p class="que"># Simile:</p>

            <p class="que">"The wind whipped through his feathers like a cold knife." (This compares the wind's effect
                to a sharp object, highlighting its intensity.)</p>
            <p class="que">"And the wrinkled water below looked like a creased green tablecloth." (This simile helps the
                reader visualize the appearance of the water from the seagull's perspective.)</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor:</p>

            <p class="que">"Hunger gnawed at him." (Hunger is personified as an animal gnawing, emphasizing its
                intensity.)</p>
            <p class="que">"The ledge was his universe." (The ledge represents the young seagull's limited world before

            <p class="que">The story heavily utilizes vivid imagery to describe the scene. Passages describe the
                vastness of the sky, the crashing waves below, and the feeling of wind rushing through the feathers.
                This imagery helps the reader experience the world through the young seagull's eyes.</p>
            <p class="que"># Repetition:</p>

            <p class="que">The repeated phrase "I can't" emphasizes the young seagull's fear and initial resistance to
                flying.</p>
            <p class="que">The use of short, choppy sentences during the initial flight sequence reflects the young
                seagull's nervousness and lack of control.</p>

            <p class="que"># Metaphor: The entire concept of the black aeroplane itself could be seen as a metaphor.
                It's a physical plane, but it also represents the unknown, the element of mystery and even the
                possibility of the supernatural that guides the pilot through the storm.</p>

            <p class="que"># Simile: There might be instances where the pilot compares the storm's intensity or the
                disorientation he feels to something else. For example, "The cockpit spun like a top" or "The rain
                lashed against the windshield like a thousand tiny fists."</p>

            <p class="que"># Symbolism: The storm itself can be seen as a symbol of the pilot's internal struggle. His
                fear and uncertainty are mirrored by the turbulence and darkness of the weather.</p>

                gift on her 13th birthday. She considered it her best friend on which she relied the most and with whom
                she shared all her ups and downs.

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne felt that paper had more patience than people to listen to her plight. So, it was easier for
                her to write all kind of thoughts which she had in her mind. Her personal diary was not meant for any
                one else to read.
            </div>

                Ans. By providing the brief sketch of her life, Anne wants to give an overview of her family, relatives
                and her age. This helps the reader to develop a connection with the author.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. What tells you that Anne loved her grandmother?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">

                close to her Grandmother. She writes in her diary . “No one knows how often I think of her and still
                love her”. On her 13th birthday by lightening up one candle for Grandmother she shows her love for her.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. Why was Mr Keesing annoyed with Anne? What did he ask her to do?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mr Keesing was annoyed with Anne because she was very talkative. He punished her by giving her
                extra homework to write essays to keep her silent and the topics always related to her nature.

            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.7. How did Anne justify her being a chatterbox in her essay?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne justified her being a chatterbox in her essay by explaining that it is due to her mother who
                was also very talkative and nobody could do anything about their inherited traits.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.8. Do you think Mr Keesing was a strict teacher?

            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. No, Mr Keesing was not a bad or strict teacher because a teacher did something for the welfare of
                his students. Any teacher would be annoyed if children keep on talking in the class. Secondly, if he had
                been strict he would not have laughed at Anne’s funny arguments.
            </div>


            <p class="que">
                Ques.9. What made Mr Keesing allow Anne to talk in class?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">

            <span>[Thinking about the Text (Page 54)]</span>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.1. Was Anne right when she Said that the world would not be interested in the musings of a 13 year
                old girl?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                ans. Yes, Anne was right when she said so because most of the people don’t want to give importance to a
                child’s perspective toward the world because they are too immature for the world. But Anne Frank has
                become one of the most discussed of all holocaust victims. Her ‘diary’ has been translated into many
                language.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.2. There are some examples of diary or journal entries in the ‘Before You Read’ section. Compare
                these with what Anne writes in her diary. What language was the diary originally written in? In what way
                is Anne’s diary different?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne’s diary was entirely different from most of the examples given before the text. It was
                somewhere closer to the memoir in which the name of Raj Kapoor has been mentioned. It was originally
                written in Dutch. It has informal tone which exudes the careful nature of a teenager.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.3. Why does Anne need to give a brief sketch about her family? Does she treat ‘Kitty’ as an insider
                or an outsider?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne gave an introduction of her family in the ‘diary’ because it was hard to make other realise
                that a 13 years old teenager could write about her loneliness. Kitty was an ‘outsider’ which was gifted
                by her parents on her 13th birthday but she considered it her best friend and treated it as an insider.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.4. How does Anne feel about her father, her grandmother, Mrs Kuperus and Mr Keesing? What do these
                tell you about her?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne has fond of memories of her father, grandmother, Mrs Kuperus and Mr Keesing, who have left
                indelible impressions on her mind and affected her life a lot. The way she represents all of them in her
                diary reveals that Anne was very good at understanding people and at developing interpersonal relations.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.5. What does Anne write in her first essay?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Mr Keesing asked her to write an essay on the topic ‘A Chatterbox’ as punishment. In the essay :
                she accepted the drawbacks of being talkative but argued that it was in her genes as her mother was also
                very talkative. It was difficult to give up the habit and it was also a student’s trait. Even Mr Keesing
                laughed at the argument she had given.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.6. Anne says teachers are most unpredictable. Is Mr Keesing unpredictable?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. Anne took perfect example of Mr Keesing as an unpredictable teacher because Mr Keesing seemed to be
                indifferent towards Annes’ behaviour. Earlier he laughed but later he allowed Anne to talk in the class
                post reading her essays.
            </div>

            <p class="que">
                Ques.7. What do these statements tell you about Anne Frank as a person?
                1. We don’t seem to be able to get any closer and that’s the problem. Maybe it’s my fault that we don’t
                confide in each other.
                2. I don’t want, to jcft; down the facts in this diary the way most people would, but I want the diary
                to be my friend.
                3. Margot went to Holland in December and I followed in February, when I was plunked down on the table
                as a birthday present for Margot.
                4. If you ask me, there are so many dummies that about a quarter of the class should be kept back, but
                teachers are the most unpredictable creatures on Earth.
                5. Anyone could ramble on and leave big spaces between the words, but the trick was to come up with
                convincing arguments to prove the necessity of talking.
            </p>
            <div class="ans">
                Ans. 1. Anne is reserved.
                2. She is self-confident and inventive.
                3. She is humorous as well.
                4. Anne is intelligent.
                5. She has a sense of propriety and convincing attitude.

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 4 - " FROM THE DAIRY OF ANNE FRANK " ]</span>
            <p class="que"># Simile: Anne might occasionally use similes for vivid comparisons. For example, "The air in
                the stuffy attic felt as thick as soup."</p>
            <p class="que"># Metaphor: She might use metaphors to express complex emotions or situations. For example,
                "The war is a dark cloud hanging over our lives."</p>
            <p class="que"># Personification: She could give human qualities to inanimate objects. For example, "The
                clock ticked loudly, mocking the slow pace of our days in hiding."</p>
            <p class="que"># Imagery: This is a more likely device. Anne might use descriptive language to create a
                picture in the reader's mind. For example, "Looking out the window, I saw the sun glinting off the
                rooftops, a reminder of the world outside our secret prison."</p>

            <!-- <p class="que"> -->
            <p class="que">
                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                The story takes us back to the narrator's childhood in Goa, during the time of Portuguese influence.
                Bread, especially loaves baked in large furnaces, was a staple food. The narrative emphasizes the
                significance of bakers, called paders, in Goan culture. Their role transcended simply providing bread;
                they were ingrained in the daily life of the community.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>The Enchanting Arrival of the Baker</strong><br>
                The author reminisces about the baker's twice-daily visits. The first visit involved selling fresh
                loaves, a delightful event for the children. The sound of the baker's bamboo stick served as a wake-up
                call, even more exciting than breakfast, as children rushed to meet him, often without even brushing
                their teeth.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>A Friend and Delights for Children</strong><br>
                The baker wasn't just a bread vendor; he was a friendly presence for the children. He offered special
                treats – bread bangles or "kankon" – made especially for them, adding to the joy of his arrival.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Loaves for the Household and the Enduring Bakery Business</strong><br>
                Adults typically didn't interact with the baker directly. Loaves were usually purchased by maidservants
                for household consumption, often enjoyed with tea. The story highlights the various uses of bread in
                Goan life, including sweet bread called Bol, a vital part of weddings, and its role in making cakes and
                sandwiches. The baker's attire, a unique knee-length frock called a "kabai," is also mentioned.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>A Glimpse into a Fading Tradition</strong><br>
                The passage subtly hints at a changing Goa. While the baker's profession remains a profitable one, the
                tradition of the distinctive loaves and the "kabai" dress might be fading.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Enduring Legacy</strong><br>
                The story concludes by celebrating the enduring legacy of bakers in Goa. Though the Portuguese era may
                have ended, the baker's presence continues to be a cherished part of Goan life and culture.

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                The chapter "Coorg," from the textbook excerpt "Glimpses of India," dives into the beauty and unique
                characteristics of Coorg, a district in Karnataka, India.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Enchanting Landscape</strong><br>
                The passage paints a picture of Coorg as a place of idyllic charm. Lush evergreen forests blanket the
                hills, while coffee plantations and spice gardens add a touch of aroma and visual intrigue. The author
                compares Coorg to heaven, emphasizing its pleasant climate, especially between September and March,
                which makes it a popular tourist destination.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Coffee Culture</strong><br>
                Coffee is deeply ingrained in Coorg's identity. The text mentions the pervasiveness of the coffee aroma
                in the air, highlighting its significance.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>The Coorg People</strong><br>
                The Coorg people, also known as Kodavas, are another aspect that the chapter explores. The passage
                mentions a theory suggesting their possible Greek or Arabic descent, linked to a story about Alexander's
                army settling there. Their distinct attire, the long black coat called Kuppia, is also noted. More
                importantly, the chapter emphasizes the Coorg people's bravery. Their well-deserved reputation is
                reflected in the famous Coorg Regiment of the Indian Army, and the fact that India's first army chief,
                General Cariappa, hailed from Coorg.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Geographical Significance</strong><br>
                The Coorg region plays a vital role in the water supply, with its hills and forests acting as the source
                for the Cauvery River, a lifeline for many areas.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                Overall, "Coorg" offers a glimpse into a captivating place in India, known for its stunning natural
                beauty, rich coffee culture, and the valiant Coorg people.

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
                The chapter "Tea from Assam," which is part of a larger work titled "Cleanliness of India," tells the
                story of two friends, Pranjol and Rajvir. Pranjol, originally from Assam, invites his classmate Rajvir
                to visit his home during the summer break.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Journey and Tea Facts</strong><br>
                Their journey by train becomes an exploration of the world of tea. As they sip chai, Rajvir reveals a
                surprising fact: over 80 crore cups of tea are consumed globally every day! This sparks a conversation
                about the history and origins of tea.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Legends of Tea</strong><br>
                Rajvir shares two interesting legends. One is a Chinese tale about an emperor who accidentally
                discovered tea when leaves from a burning bush fell into his boiling water. The other is an Indian
                legend about Bodhidharma, a Buddhist monk who cut off his eyelids to stay awake during meditation. From
                his discarded eyelids, tea plants are said to have grown.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Arrival at Tea Estate</strong><br>
                Pranjol and Rajvir arrive at Mariani junction and head to Dhekibari Tea Estate, managed by Pranjol's
                father. Here, they witness firsthand the process of tea plucking, with women using bamboo baskets to
                collect the fresh leaves.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
                The chapter is a delightful blend of travelogue, history lesson, and cultural exploration. It paints a
                vivid picture of Assam's tea plantations and the significance of tea in our daily lives. While the title
                "Cleanliness of India" might seem unrelated, this chapter focuses on a different kind of "cleanliness" -
                the fresh, invigorating experience of a cup of tea.

                The story doesn't focus on a single baker but rather the entire profession as a cornerstone of Goan
                culture. The bakers are described as skilled artisans with "mixers, moulders, and those who bake the
                loaves." They are seen as hardworking and reliable, visiting twice a day and keeping their "age-old,
                time-tested furnaces" burning. The passage implies a sense of prosperity for the bakers, stating their

                He enjoys detective stories and is fascinated by everything new he experiences on the tea estate. His
                inquisitiveness about tea is evident when he is surprised by the sheer volume of tea consumed globally.

                <strong>Simile:</strong><br>
                The most likely poetic device you might encounter is a simile. The author might compare something
                related to the baker or bread to something else to create a vivid image. For instance, "The loaves of
                bread were golden brown, like suns just peeking over the horizon." (This is an invented example, not a
                direct quote from the passage).

                <strong>Question 1.</strong><br>
                What ‘experiment’ did Maxwell think Camusfearna would be suitable for?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                The writer had gone to Southern Iraq in the year 1956. He took a fancy to the idea that instead of
                keeping a dog as a pet, he would go for an otter. Camusfearna was surrounded by water, so it would be an
                eminently suitable spot for this experiment.

                Answer:<br>
                The writer went to Basra to collect and answer his mail from Europe.<br>
                He had to wait there for 5 days as his mail did not arrive.

                How does he get the otter? Does he like it? Pick out the words that tell you this.<br>
                Answer:<br>
                His friend bought the otter for him and sent it to the place where he was staying.<br>
                The author liked it. This is seen in “The second night Mijbil came on to my bed in the small hours and
                remained asleep in the crook of my knees….” “I made a body-belt for him…”.

                <strong>Question 4.</strong><br>
                Why was the otter named ‘Maxwell’s otter’?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                The otter was named by zoologists as Lutrogale Perspicillata Maxwelli. Hence, it was called Maxwell’s
                otter in short.

                What happened when Maxwell took Mijbil to the bathroom? What did it do two days after that?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                When the author first took Mijbil to the bathroom, the otter first went wild with joy in the water. He
                plunged and rolled in it. He jumped up and down the length of the bathtub. He made enough slosh and
                splash. After two days, the otter suddenly disappeared and went to the bathroom to play in the water and
                opened the tap on his own.

                <strong>Question 1.</strong><br>
                How was Mijbil transported to England?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                Mijbil was packed in a box as the airlines had directed the author. As British airlines did not allow
                pets on board the author had to book a ticket on a different airline from Iraq to Paris and then Paris
                to London.

                What did Mij do to the box?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                The box was lined with a metal sheet. Mij didn’t feel comfortable in the box and tried to escape. In his
                attempt to escape, Mij tore into the metal lining of the box and in the process hurt himself.

                Why did Maxwell put the otter back in the box? How do you think he felt when he did this?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                As there was no other way to carry Mij to London, Maxwell put him in the box again. He must have felt
                pity on the way the otter hurt himself. Moreover, he must be worried as well.

                <strong>Question 4.</strong><br>
                Why does Maxwell say the airhostess was “the very queen of her kind”?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                The airhostess was very sympathetic after listening to Maxwell’s story. She understood how he might be
                feeling and then gave him permission to take the otter out of the box. Due to all this, Maxwell referred
                to her as “the very queen of her kind”.

                Answer:<br>
                As soon as the box was opened, Mij ran out. Then it ran all over the place scaring all the passengers.
                It created a chaos and most of the people in the plane got scared.

                Answer:<br>
                Mij invented a game of playing with the ball in a unique way. One of the author’s suitcase was damaged
                and had a slope on the top part. Mij would put the ball on the high end and run to catch it as it slid

                1. school children<br>
                2. Mij?<br>
                Answer:<br>
                Compulsive habits are usually strange acts or behaviors which a person does without a clear reason. For
                example, a cricket player may put on his right shoes first as he believes it would bring him good luck,
                or a kid jumping over a fence instead of going through the passageway. Usually, compulsive behavior of
                children is full of childhood mischief, and those of adults are of the incorrigible type.<br>
                1. As per this story, children must place their feet squarely on the center of each paving block; must
                touch every seventh upright of the iron railings, or pass to the outside of every second lamp post.<br>
                2. Mijbil while on its way home would jump over the boundary wall railing and run at full speed
                throughout its length.

                Answer:<br>
                Otters belong to a comparatively small group of animals called Mustellines. The other animals of this
                group are badger, mongoose, weasel, stoat, mink, and others.

                As otters are not found in England, Londoners made the wildest possible guesses about Mij. Their guesses

                Answer:<br>
                Mij invented his own game out of a ping-pong ball and a worn-down suitcase. He loved water, and once he
                understood that opening the tap caused water to come out, he would get into the tub and play with

                policies.<br>
                The author resorts to transporting Mij in a small box, leading to a chaotic situation when Mij escapes
                mid-flight.<br>
                Fortunately, with the help of a kind air hostess, the author and Mij manage to reach London safely.</p>

            <p class="que">Life with Mij</p>

            <p class="que">The story depicts Mij's playful personality and his fascination with toys.<br>
                The author describes the unique challenges and joys of having an otter as a pet.<br>
                The chapter concludes without revealing the specifics of Mij's life in the author's London flat, leaving
                the reader curious about their future adventures.</p>

            <p class="que">Themes</p>

            <p class="que">The story explores themes of companionship, overcoming challenges, and the unique bond
                between humans and animals.<br>
                It also provides a glimpse into the playful nature of otters.</p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Playful:</strong><br>
                The story highlights Mijbil's love for games and toys. He enjoys juggling objects on his back and has a
                particular fascination with marbles.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Curious:</strong><br>
                Mijbil's inquisitive nature is evident in his exploration of his surroundings and his attempts to
                interact with new objects.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Affectionate:</strong><br>
                Despite being a wild animal, Mijbil forms a bond with Maxwell, seeking comfort by nuzzling him.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Destructive:</strong><br>
                Mijbil's playful nature can sometimes be destructive, as seen when he tries to tear through his travel
                box, injuring himself.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Unruly:</strong><br>
                As a wild animal, Mijbil is not fully domesticated and exhibits unpredictable behaviour.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>The Wild vs. Domestic:</strong><br>
                The story explores the inherent conflict between Mijbil's wild instincts and the attempt to keep him as
                a pet. This creates a dynamic where some of Mijbil's behaviours, natural for an otter in the wild,
                become disruptive in a domestic setting.
            </p>

            <p class="que">
                <strong>Overall:</strong><br>
                Mijbil is a charming and energetic character who embodies the playful spirit of otters. The story
                explores the challenges and joys of caring for an unusual pet, highlighting Mijbil's unique personality.

            <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 6 - " Mijbil the Otter " ]</span>
            <p class="que"><strong>Simile:</strong><br>
                The story might use similes to describe Mijbil's playful actions. For instance, it could compare the way
                Mijbil juggles objects to a skilled performer, like "He balanced the ping-pong ball on his nose with the
                dexterity of a circus seal."
            </p>

            <p class="que"><strong>Figurative Language in Descriptions:</strong><br>
                The use of descriptive language itself can be considered a poetic device. The chapter might depict
                Mijbil's appearance using evocative words, like his "sleek, dark fur" or his "bright, inquisitive eyes."
            </p>

            <p class="que"><strong>Personification:</strong><br>
                The story might occasionally use personification to describe Mijbil's actions or emotions. For example,
                it could describe Mij nuzzling the author as "offering a comforting hug."

            <span>[ NCERT Solutions of CHAPTER : 7 -- " MADAM RIDES A BUS " ]</span>
            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                What was Valli’s favourite pastime?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli’s favourite pastime was standing in the front doorway of her house and looking at the
                street outside.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                What was the source of unending joy for Valli? What was her strongest desire?</p>
            <div class="ans">The sight of the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town, filled each
                time with a new set of passengers, was a source of unending joy for Valli. Her strongest desire was to
                ride the bus.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                What did Valli find out about the bus journey? How did she find these details?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli found out that the bus journey to the town took 45 minutes and the one-way fare cost
                30 paisa. She listened carefully to the conversations between her neighbours and people who regularly
                used the bus and asked a few discreet questions here and there. This way she picked up various small
                details about the bus journey.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                What do you think Valli was planning to do?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli was planning to go to the town and then return back by the same bus. The fare was 30
                paise one way and the ride took forty-five minutes. In this way, she planned that she would be back by
                2:45 pm if she took the bus at 1:00 pm.</div>

            <p class="que">Page 122</p>

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                Why does the conductor call Valli ‘madam’?</p>
            <div class="ans">The conductor called Valli ‘madam’ because she behaved like a woman. She declined his help
                and was very quick in her answers to the conductor’s questions. This made the conductor call her madam.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                Why does Valli stand up on the seat? (or) What does she see now?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli wanted to look outside the bus. She found her view blocked by the canvas blind that
                covered the lower part of the window. In order to have a better view, she stood up on the seat and
                peered over the blind. She saw a canal, palm trees, grassland, mountains, green fields, and the sky.
            </div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                What does Valli tell the elderly man when he calls her a child?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli replied that there was nobody in the bus who was a child. She told him that she had
                paid her fare of 30 paise like everyone else.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                Why didn’t Valli want to make friends with the elderly woman?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli did not want to make friends with the elderly woman because she looked quite
                repulsive. She had big earholes and was wearing ugly earrings. Apart from this, she was chewing betel
                and her mouth was also filled with betel juice.</div>

            <p class="que">Page 125</p>

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                How did Valli save money for her first journey? Was it easy for her?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli had very painstakingly saved every stray coin that came her way by resisting every
                temptation to buy peppermints, toys, balloons, etc. It had been very difficult for her. Even at the
                village fair, she resisted the temptation to be on the merry-go-round. Thus, she had been able to save
                sixty paise for her first bus journey.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                What did Valli see on her way that made her laugh?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli saw a young cow, tail high in the air, running very fast right in the middle of the
                road in front of the bus. The driver sounded his horn again and again so that the cow would move away.
                But the more he honked, the more frightened the animal became and faster it galloped. This all seemed
                very funny to Valli and she laughed and laughed till there were tears in her eyes.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                Why didn’t she get off the bus at the bus station?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli had planned that she only wanted to ride on the bus. She would spend thirty paise on
                her fare, go to the town, and then come back by the same bus before her mother woke up. She didn’t have
                time or money to go to see the town.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                Why didn’t Valli want to go to the stall to have a drink? What does this tell you about her?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli had saved only sixty paise for the trip. She didn’t want to waste any money on the
                drink as she had to come back by the same bus at any cost. So, when the conductor suggested she get down
                and have a drink, she refused. He offered to bring one for her, but she still refused. This shows that
                she was a well-mannered girl.</div>

            <p class="que">Thinking About The Text (Page 127)</p>

            <p class="que">Question 1:<br>
                What was Valli’s deepest desire? Find the words and phrases in the story that tell you this.</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli’s deepest desire was to go on a bus ride. The words and phrases in the story that
                tell this are ‘source of unending joy’, ‘stare wistfully’, and ‘kindle in her longings, dreams and
                hopes’.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 2:<br>
                How did Valli plan her bus ride? What did she find out about the bus, and how did she save up the fare?
            </p>
            <div class="ans">Over many days and months, Valli listened carefully to conversations between her neighbours
                and people who regularly used the bus and asked a few discreet questions here and there. She came to
                know that the town was six miles from her village, the bus fare was thirty paise, and the bus trip took
                forty-five minutes. She also thought that if she stayed on the bus and came back by the same bus, it
                would only cost her sixty paise. She painstakingly saved each and every penny she got, resisting all
                temptation to buy peppermints, toys, etc., and even a ride on the merry-go-round at the village annual
                fair so as to save sixty paise. It was a secret trip which she had planned without the knowledge of her
                parents.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 3:<br>
                What kind of person is Valli? To answer this question, pick out the following sentences from the text
                and fill in the blanks. The words you fill in are the clues to your answer.</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli was a confident girl who did not think that her age was a limitation to her
                travelling alone to the town. She considered herself a grown-up and acted like one.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 4:<br>
                Why does the conductor refer to Valli as ‘Madam’?</p>
            <div class="ans">The conductor called Valli ‘Madam’ as she behaved like a grown-up and did not think that
                she was a child. She also refused his help and told him that she could manage on her own.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 5:<br>
                Find the lines in the text which tell you that Valli was enjoying her ride on the bus.</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli thoroughly enjoyed her ride in the bus. The following lines from the text tell us
                about it. She saw so many things on her way—a canal, palm trees, grasslands, distant mountains. “Oh! it
                was all so wonderful,” that’s what she felt. “Sometimes the bus seemed on the point of gobbling up
                another vehicle that was coming towards them or a pedestrian crossing the road. Somehow it passed
                smoothly, leaving all obstacles behind,” and then she saw a cow running very fast in front of the bus.
                This all seemed very funny to Valli and she laughed and laughed till tears flowed from her eyes.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 6:<br>
                Why does Valli refuse to look out of the window on her way back?</p>
            <div class="ans">Valli refused to look out of the window on her way back as she saw the dead body of the cow
                who was running towards the bus when she was going to town. This made her sad and frightened.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 7:<br>
                What does Valli mean when she says… “I was just agreeing with you what you said about things happening
                without our knowledge”?</p>
            <div class="ans">While making this statement, Valli was trying to hide the fact about her bus ride. She was
                also feeling elated at making a successful attempt at her plan.</div>

            <p class="que">Question 8:<br>
                The author describes the things that Valli sees from an 8-year-old’s point of view. Can you find
                evidence from the text for his statement?</p>
            <div class="ans">Yes, for example when the author says, ‘she was fascinated by the bus’ and ‘watching the
                bus fill with a new set of people each time was a source of unending joy for her’. When the author
                describes the bus, he stresses on the colour and look of the new bus ‘like silver’ because a child

                    <strong>Valli, the Curious Girl:</strong><br>
                    The story revolves around Valliammai, an eight-year-old girl nicknamed Valli. Unlike other children
                    who play outside, Valli finds her entertainment observing the world from her doorstep. Her favorite
                    sight is the big, yellow bus that rumbles past her village every half hour, ferrying passengers to
                    the nearby town.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>A Dream Takes Root:</strong><br>
                    Valli is mesmerized by the bus and the stories of the town shared by the villagers. She yearns to
                    experience this world beyond her village and ride the bus herself. Fueled by this desire, she starts
                    gathering information about the bus route, timings, and fare.
                </p>
                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Saving for Freedom:</strong><br>
                    Valli understands that a bus ride requires money. She diligently saves every penny she can, from
                    helping her mother with chores to collecting fallen mangoes. She even devises clever ways to save,
                    like hiding a paisa (a small denomination coin) whenever she receives it for buying groceries.
                </p>
                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Planning the Adventure:</strong><br>
                    Valli knows her mother wouldn't allow her to travel alone. So, she meticulously plans her trip for a
                    day when her mother wakes up late for her afternoon nap. She packs a small bag with essentials like
                    peanuts and a water bottle, feeling a thrill of excitement and nervousness.

                    <strong>The Big Day Arrives:</strong><br>
                    The much-anticipated day dawns. Valli wakes up early, dressed in her best clothes, and waits
                    anxiously for the bus. When it arrives, she gathers her courage, boards the bus, and pays the fare
                    with her hard-earned savings.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>A World Unfolds:</strong><br>
                    The journey itself is a revelation for Valli. She watches the unfamiliar sights and landscapes
                    unfold before her, filled with wonder. She observes the passengers—a crying baby, an old woman
                    chewing betel nut, a group of men discussing politics. Each scene adds to her growing understanding
                    of the world.

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Reaching the Town:</strong><br>
                    The bus arrives at the town, a bustling place with shops, markets, and towering buildings. Valli
                    steps off, overwhelmed by the sights and sounds. Although she doesn't venture far, she experiences a
                    sense of accomplishment and independence.

                    Remembering her mother, Valli knows she must return before her nap is over. She boards the return
                    bus, her mind buzzing with the day's experiences. Back in her village, she sneaks back home,
                    relieved and exhilarated by her secret adventure.

                    <strong>Valliammai (Valli):</strong><br>
                    Curious and Adventurous: Valli's defining trait is her insatiable curiosity about the world beyond
                    her village. She is fascinated by the bus and the stories of the town, fueling her desire for
                    adventure.<br><br>
                    Observant and Resourceful: Valli is a keen observer, gathering information about the bus route,
                    timings, and fare. She is resourceful, saving every penny and devising clever ways to accumulate
                    money for her trip.<br><br>

                    detection during her trip.
                </p>

                <p class="que">

                    Hardworking and Caring: Though not directly portrayed, Valli's mother is likely hardworking, looking
                    after the household and providing for Valli. Her caring nature is evident in Valli's desire not to

                <p class="que">
                    <strong>Other Characters:</strong><br>
                    The story features a cast of minor characters on the bus, offering glimpses into the wider
                    world:<br><br>
                    Crying Baby: Represents the innocence and vulnerability of childhood.<br><br>
                    Betel Nut Chewing Woman: Represents a glimpse into local customs and habits.<br><br>

                    <strong>Overall:</strong><br>
                    The characters in "Madam Rides the Bus" serve to highlight Valli's journey of self-discovery and her

                <p class="que"><strong>Simile:</strong><br>
                    While not explicitly stated, the poem might use similes to depict Valli's observations. For instance, it could compare the way the bus travels to a "lumbering yellow giant" or describe the passengers' chatter as "a buzzing hive of voices."


"
                </p>
    
                <p class="que"><strong>Metaphor:</strong><br>
                    The title itself, "Madam Rides the Bus," can be considered a metaphor. "Madam" is a term of respect typically used for older women, contrasting with Valli's young age. This metaphor highlights Valli's desire to be seen as independent and grown-up.
                </p>
    
                <p class="que"><strong>Personification:</strong><br>
                    The poem might use personification to describe inanimate objects. For instance, it could describe the bus "winking" its headlights or the road "stretching out" before Valli. This technique personalizes the experience and adds a touch of wonder.

                    writer’s faith in God. He didn’t want to shake Lencho’s faith. So, he decided to collect ,money and

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                    Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                    When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                    faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees
                    and
                    friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is
                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had
                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    Unquestioning,
                    It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of
                    person.
                    He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is
                    totally
                    lovable and different
                </div>

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
                postmaster.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.

                <pre class="que"># God (Indirect Character):

                Represents Faith and Hope: While not a physical character, God embodies the concept of faith as a source
                of hope and the belief in a higher power's intervention.</pre>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                    Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                    When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                    faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees
                    and

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had
                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is

                    lovable and different

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

                Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
                letter seeking aid.

                Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
                rebuild.

                Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
                money's source.
            </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

                Initially Amused: Finds the idea of a letter to God humorous.

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b1_ch9">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.

                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                    Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                    Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or

                    Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had
                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is

                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the

                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep

                    When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his

                    and
                    friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch2">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. The postmaster sends money to Lencho in order to keep
                    Lencho’s faith in God alive and firm as he was completely moved by it.


                    When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his
                    faith and decides to answer the letter. He gathers money with the help of his post office employees
                    and
                    friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch3">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                    When postmaster reads the letter of Lencho to God, he becomes serious and does not want to shake his

                    and

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had
                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is

                    lovable and different

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or

                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    person.
                    He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is
                    totally
                    lovable and different
                </div>

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or

                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    Comical,
                    Unquestioning,
                    It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of
                    person.
                    He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is
                    totally
                    lovable and different

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                    and
                    friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch7">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                <div class="ans">
                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our
                    problems. There are few sentences which show this

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.
                    God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied Lencho what he had requested.

                    and
                    friends on behalf of God and signs the letter ‘God’ so that Lencho’s faith does not get shaken.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    (Remember that the irony of a situation is an unexpected aspect of it. An ironic situation is
                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had
                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried

                    It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>

                    ans. Lencho has complete faith in God as he is instructed that God knows everything and helps us in
                    our

                    But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a
                    single hope help from God.
                    All through the night, Lencho thought only of his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he had
                    been
                    instructed, see everything, even what is deep in one’s conscience.
                    “God”, he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family and I will go hungry this year”.
                    He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter inside and still troubled, went to town.

                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Lencho did not try to find out who had sent the money to him because he never suspected the
                    presence of God and had complete faith in God. He could not believe that it could be – anybody else
                    other than him who would send him the money.
                    His faith in God was so strong that he believed that he had sent money to him for his help in his

                    strange or
                    amusing because it is the opposite of what is expected).

                    Ans. Lencho thinks that the post office employees have taken the rest of the money as he had
                    demanded a
                    hundred pesos from God and in the letter there was only seventy pesos and God cannot make such a
                    mistake. So, he assumes that they have stolen the money.
                    The irony in this situation is that Lencho suspects those people who helped him in his problem and
                    tried
                    to keep his faith alive in God.

                    Unquestioning,
                    It is almost impossible to find a person like Lencho as he is an unquestioning and naive kind of
                    person.
                    He is not stupid if he doesn’t know who has sent him money or a letter will reach God without any
                    address. It is Lencho’s faith in God. In real world, people are selfish and greedy and Lencho is

                    Ques.6. There are two kinds of conflict in the story between humans and nature and between humans
                    themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
                </p>
                <div class="ans">
                    Ans. Conflict between Humans and Nature: The conflict between humans and nature is illustrated by
                    the
                    destruction of Lencho’s crop by the hailstorm as Lencho was expecting a good rain to have good
                    harvest
                    as that was the only hope he had for his earning. He worked so hard to feed his family, but nature
                    turned violent and destroyed everything.
                    Conflict between Humans and Humans: The story also illustrated another conflict, between humans
                    themselves as the postmaster alongwith his friends and staff sent Lencho money that Lencho demanded
                    from
                    God although they didn’t know Lencho. Lencho blamed them for taking away some amount of money. He
                    called
                    them “a bunch of crook”. This shows that man does not have faith in other man, thereby giving rise
                    to
                    this conflict.

                <p class="que">[A Letter to God: A Story of Faith, Humanity, and Misunderstanding]</p>
                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" by G.L. Fuentes tells the poignant tale of Lencho, a simple farmer
                    whose
                    life revolves around his cornfield. He awaits the rains with eager anticipation, knowing they will
                    nourish his crops and bring him a bountiful harvest. His dreams are shattered when a violent
                    hailstorm
                    descends upon his land, leaving his field utterly destroyed.</p>

                <p class="que">Faced with despair and the threat of starvation, Lencho doesn't succumb to hopelessness.
                    His
                    unwavering faith in God becomes his anchor. He believes that God, a benevolent being, will surely
                    help
                    those in need. With this unwavering conviction, Lencho takes an unusual step – he writes a letter
                    directly addressed to God. In his simple, heartfelt language, he describes the devastation caused by
                    the
                    hailstorm and requests a hundred pesos to rebuild his life.</p>

                <p class="que">The letter reaches the post office, where the postman is initially taken aback by the
                    unconventional address. However, upon reading Lencho's sincere plea, the postman is deeply moved by
                    the
                    farmer's faith. He can't bear to see such unwavering belief go unanswered.</p>

                <p class="que">The postman takes the letter to the postmaster, sharing Lencho's plight. Although
                    initially
                    amused by the idea of a letter to God, the postmaster is ultimately touched by Lencho's simple
                    faith. He
                    recognizes the importance of keeping such belief alive.</p>

                <p class="que">However, the postmaster lacks the resources to fulfill Lencho's request on his own. He
                    decides to take action. He rallies the employees at the post office, appealing to their compassion.
                    Together, they collect a sum of money, less than the hundred pesos Lencho requested.</p>

                <p class="que">The money is sent anonymously to Lencho, with the address simply stating "From God."
                    Lencho
                    is overjoyed to receive the money, a tangible answer to his prayers. However, there's a touch of
                    confusion when he discovers the amount is less than he requested.</p>

                <p class="que">Lencho, in his innocence, believes God must have deducted the postal workers' fees from
                    the
                    money he sent. Though his faith remains unshaken, a hint of doubt creeps in – a misunderstanding
                    about
                    the source of the money and the nature of God's help.</p>

                <p class="que">"A Letter to God" is a powerful story that explores the enduring power of faith. It
                    highlights the kindness and compassion that can exist within ordinary people. The story also
                    introduces
                    a touch of irony with the misunderstanding about the money, reminding us that good intentions can
                    sometimes have unexpected consequences.</p>

                <p class="que"></p>
                <pre class="que"># Lencho:

            Deeply Religious  :  His unshakeable faith in God as a personal helper defines him. He writes a direct
            letter seeking aid.

            Hardworking and Resilient :  A dedicated farmer, he doesn't give up after the hailstorm but seeks help to
            rebuild.

            Innocent and Trusting :  His faith borders on innocence, evident in writing to God and misinterpreting the
            money's source.
        </pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postman:

            Compassionate: Touched by Lencho's faith, he becomes the catalyst for action, taking the letter to the
            postmaster.</pre>
                <pre class="que"># The Postmaster:

            <div class="content " id="poetic_b2_ch9">
                <span>[ Poetic Devices of CHAPTER : 1 - " A LETTER TO GOD " ]</span>
                <p class="que"># Simile: Though not explicitly stated, there's an implied simile when Lencho's field is
                    described as "white, as if covered with salt" after the hailstorm. This comparison paints a vivid
                    image
                    of the devastation.</p>
                <p class="que"># Metaphor: The "plague of locusts" is mentioned to emphasize the severity of the
                    hailstorm's
                    destruction. Locusts are known for devouring crops, so this metaphor highlights the extent of the
                    damage.</p>
                <p class="que"># Personification: The ravaged field could be seen as personified. When it's described as
                    "looking like a sick child," it evokes a sense of sympathy for the loss of Lencho's livelihood.</p>
                <p class="que"># Repetition: The word "God" is repeated throughout the story, emphasizing Lencho's
                    unwavering faith and his direct communication with a higher power.</p>
                <p class="que"># Imagery: The story relies heavily on imagery to create a clear picture of Lencho's
                    life,
                    the hailstorm's destruction, and his simple faith. Descriptions of the cornfield, the postman's
                    touch,
                    and Lencho's hopeful eyes all contribute to the story's impact.</p>
                <p class="que">It's important to note that these poetic devices are used sparingly and subtly. The
                    beauty of
                    the story lies in its straightforward language and focus on the characters' emotions </p>
